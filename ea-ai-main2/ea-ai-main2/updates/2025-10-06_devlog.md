## Markdown renderer simplification for chat (19:40)

**Status**: ✅ Minimal, secure chat markdown; noted formatting gaps to fix next

### Context
Chat needs only basic formatting. The existing setup mixed Shiki/Prism, math (KaTeX), and duplicate renderers, adding complexity and breaking in places.

### Changes Made
- src/components/ai-elements/response.tsx: removed math (remark-math, rehype-katex) and code-highlighting path (CodeBlock/CopyButton, Prism).
- src/components/ai-elements/response.tsx: kept HardenedMarkdown + remark-gfm + parseIncompleteMarkdown; simplified `pre`/`code` to plain styled output.
- Security defaults tightened: `allowedImagePrefixes: []`, `allowedLinkPrefixes: ['https://','http://','/']`.
- Removed unused imports (e.g., KaTeX CSS, isValidElement).

### Result
Renderer now focuses on conversational text with basic GFM (lists, links, emphasis) and hardened links. No Shiki/Prism/KaTeX code paths.

### Known issues / next steps
- Some markdown emphasis in titles (double asterisks around headings) is not always rendered during streaming; root cause likely partial token boundaries despite `parseIncompleteMarkdown`. Reproduce with streamed headings and adjust the parser to handle bold/heading combos (e.g., `## **Title**`).
- Decide whether to allow images (currently blocked) and whether tables are needed; if yes, add minimal table styling only.
- After stabilization, consider pruning unused deps (react-syntax-highlighter, shiki, rehype-katex, remark-math, marked) if not used elsewhere.
