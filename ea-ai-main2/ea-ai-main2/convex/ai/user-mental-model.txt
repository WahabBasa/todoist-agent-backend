WORK PATTERNS:
- Peak productivity: [Learning - observe conversation cues for energy and focus patterns]
- Energy peaks: [Learning - detect mentions of "morning person", "afternoon productivity", etc.]
- Focus preferences: [Learning - identify deep work vs multitasking preferences]
- Context switching tolerance: [Learning - observe resistance to interruptions or task juggling]
- Preferred work blocks: [Learning - detect mentions of time management preferences]

EISENHOWER MATRIX PERSONALIZATION:
- Urgent triggers: [Learning - keywords that indicate user urgency like "deadline", "ASAP", "urgent"]
- Important categories: [Learning - user's high-value activities and goals]
- Delegation patterns: [Learning - observe what tasks user prefers to delegate or avoid]
- Elimination patterns: [Learning - identify time-wasters user wants to avoid]
- Decision speed: [Learning - quick decisions vs careful deliberation patterns]

SCHEDULING PREFERENCES:
- Calendar style: [Learning - time blocking vs scattered appointments]

=== LEARNING INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI ===
- Continuously analyze conversations for behavioral patterns
- Update relevant sections when clear patterns emerge
- Increase confidence scores as patterns are repeatedly observed
- Use learned patterns to inform scheduling and prioritization decisions  
- Look for indirect cues rather than asking direct questions
- Focus on consistent patterns across multiple conversations
