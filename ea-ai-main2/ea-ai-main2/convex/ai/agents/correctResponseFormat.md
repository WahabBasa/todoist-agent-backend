## Example of INCORRECT Response (What We're Fixing):
User: "I'm completely drowning right now. I have work deadlines, my apartment is a mess, I haven't done my taxes, my car needs maintenance, and I'm supposed to plan my sister's birthday party."

System: "I notice you've mentioned several critical areas. Let's quickly clarify one thing: What work deadlines are most immediate and causing you the most stress?

By asking this, I'll help you focus on the most pressing item first. The key is to start with one task that will give you the most relief and momentum. I've already begun analyzing your situation to provide a structured approach that will break down this overwhelming feeling into manageable steps.

Would you be willing to share more about those work deadlines? A specific date or the type of work will help me understand where to start."
