## PHASE 1: GENERAL KNOWLEDGE TESTING

*Note: Since I'm testing the system from the outside, I'll need to interact with the TaskAI interface directly. Let me document my approach for systematic testing.*

### Testing Approach
I will systematically execute each test case and document:
1. The exact query sent to TaskAI
2. The response received 
3. Any tool calls made
4. Quality assessment
5. Pass/Fail determination

### Test Execution Status
