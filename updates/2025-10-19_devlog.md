 
## Calendar re-consent flow + AI reply fallback fixes (09:10)

**Status**: ✅ Google Calendar re-consent enforced; misleading completion text removed

Changes Made:
- `ea-ai-main2/ea-ai-main2/convex/googleCalendar/auth.ts:64-106, 144-170, 198-241, 268-306, 335-374` — Added Clerk token scope discovery (tokeninfo), enforced required scopes per endpoint, improved connection test messaging, and revoked legacy token on disconnect.
- `ea-ai-main2/ea-ai-main2/src/views/SettingsView.tsx: ~320-385` — Reconnect flow passes `additionalScopes` and `prompt:'consent'` to Clerk `createExternalAccount/reauthorize`; disconnect removes external account and revokes legacy tokens to force re-consent.
- `ea-ai-main2/ea-ai-main2/convex/ai/session.ts: ~780-820, ~1040-1065` — Replaced fallback response "I've completed the requested actions." with safe, intent-aware prompts (no false completion); added a clarifying question for planning.
- Prompts (minimal, targeted):
  - `prompts/zen_new.ts` — Added constraints to avoid completion claims on info-only queries and prefer read-only calendar access.
  - `prompts/planning_new.ts` — For info-only intent, ask one concise question instead of planning side-effects.
  - `prompts/task_breakdown.ts` — Avoid completion phrasing for informational outcomes.

Result:
- After disconnecting, reconnect now shows Google consent again and grants read/write scopes; calendar reads and event creation work without scope errors. AI no longer claims "completed" for info queries; it answers or asks a brief follow-up instead.
