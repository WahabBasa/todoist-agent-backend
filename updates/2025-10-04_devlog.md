Last devlog (2025-10-03) had 11,412 bytes - need to review for recent debugging sessions and lessons learned.

## System Analysis Complete

### Latest Devlog Review (2025-10-03)
**Status**: Streaming Chat Refactor implemented but facing deployment issues
- ✅ Implemented Convex httpAction streaming with Vercel AI SDK useChat
- ✅ Added Clerk JWT authentication per request 
- ✅ Fixed frontend input freeze and trim() crashes
- ⚠️ **Current Issue**: Cloud deployment returns 404s for `/chat` endpoint - route not yet deployed to `peaceful-boar-923.convex.site`
- ⚠️ **CORS Setup**: Added to all responses, but auth failing (401) due to missing Convex JWT configuration

### CSS Design System Review
**System**: ChatGPT-inspired grey theme with TailwindCSS v4
- **Typography**: 4-tier attention system (Primary/Secondary/Tertiary/Utility) with HSL white intensity colors
- **Spacing**: UX-driven attention-based spacing system
- **Colors**: Professional grey theme with blue accent buttons
- **Components**: Complete ChatGPT-clone architecture with smooth transitions

### Project Structure Analysis
**Active Project**: `ea-ai-main2/ea-ai-main2/` (React 19 + TypeScript + Convex)
- **Frontend**: `src/` with chat interface, UI primitives, hooks
- **Backend**: `convex/` with AI orchestration, schema, http actions
- **Build**: Vite with PostCSS/Tailwind processing
- **Auth**: Clerk integration with Convex JWT template

### Security Review
**User Base Status**: No active users detected in devlogs
**AgentDeskAI Status**: Not yet triggered - requires paying users
**Action**: Continue development, monitor for user metrics

## Current Development Status
**Branch**: `fix-google-calendar-tool-2025-09-30`
**Focus**: Streaming chat refactor completion
**Blocker**: Convex deployment missing new httpAction routes

## Startup Routine Complete - October 4, 2025 7:50 AM

### Project Structure Verification
- ✅ Active project: `ea-ai-main2/ea-ai-main2/` (React 19 + TypeScript + Convex)
- ✅ CSS Design System: ChatGPT grey theme with TailwindCSS v4 - 4-tier attention typography
- ✅ PostCSS Configuration: `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin confirmed
- ✅ Architecture Flow: React → Convex → AI SDK → Database
- ✅ Branch: `fix-google-calendar-tool-2025-09-30` (ready for deployment)

### System Status Review
- ✅ Current date verified: October 4, 2025
- ✅ Today's devlog exists and updated
- ✅ Latest devlog (2025-10-03) reviewed: Streaming refactor complete, deployment blocked
- ✅ Personal directory found - no someday todolist.md detected
- ✅ No user metrics detected in devlogs - continue development

### Current Development Context
**Focus**: Complete streaming chat refactor deployment
**Status**: Ready for Convex cloud deployment to enable `/chat` endpoint
**Blockers**: 
1. Convex functions not yet deployed to `peaceful-boar-923.convex.site`
2. `CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN` environment variable needs configuration
3. Sidebar functionality broken (New Chat + session selection)

## Next Immediate Actions
1. Deploy Convex functions to enable `/chat` endpoint on cloud
2. Configure `CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN` in Convex environment  
3. Test streaming flow end-to-end
4. Fix sidebar functionality (New Chat + session selection broken)

### Development Ready
System architecture confirmed, design system loaded, and recent context understood. Ready to proceed with deployment and debugging tasks.

### Work Log - 08:35 AM
- Updated `ChatProvider` to scope `useChat` with a session-specific `id`, refresh messages on session changes, and clear the local draft input.
- `npm run lint` aborted with Node heap OOM while running `tsc`; no further changes applied from the task.
- Switching sessions now loads the correct history, but streaming `/chat` endpoint throws `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'filter')` after the assistant reply; needs follow-up investigation to check message shape sent to Convex.

### Work Log - 02:10 PM
- Investigated cross-session reply leak and second-message 500s; analyzed Convex logs showing messageCount increments but context mix-ups.
- Reviewed OpenCode reference for session isolation and server-owned history:
  - `references/opencode-copy2/packages/opencode/src/session/index.ts` (lock/queue, BusyError, request headers, processor loop)
  - `references/opencode-copy2/packages/opencode/src/session/message-v2.ts` (toModelMessage → UIMessage → convertToModelMessages)
- Drafted OpenCode-aligned stabilization plan and saved as `planning.md` (protocol hardening, per-session lock/queue, append user turn before stream, canonical history from DB, guarded rehydration on chat switch, 409 handling).

### Next Steps
1) Client→Server protocol: always send `{sessionId, requestId, latestUserMessage, historyVersion}` + `x-session-id/x-request-id` headers.
2) Add Convex `sessionLocks` (acquire/release with TTL) and `conversations.appendUserMessage` mutation; return 409 on contention.
3) Refactor `/chat` to: acquire lock → append user → build model messages strictly from DB → persist assistant → release lock.
4) Frontend: rehydrate SDK messages only when idle; detect 409 and retry/backoff; ensure `useChat` id is the session id.
5) Logging: trace `{sessionId, requestId, historyVersion, dbCountBefore/After}` for every request.

### Work Log - 04:20 PM
- Implemented Phase 1 protocol hardening (request metadata + canonical history rebuild) and Phase 2 session locking with Convex `sessionLocks` table/mutations and try/finally cleanup in `/chat`.
- Expanded text extraction on both frontend (`ChatProvider`) and backend stream handler to include `output_text`/`assistant_message` parts and response fallbacks.
- Local regression test: first turn streams correctly; second turn still triggers client-side "No response was generated" despite 200 OK and persisted assistant reply in Convex.
- Need deeper AI SDK investigation—likely response handler expectation mismatch after new metadata/lock changes.

### Outstanding Issues
- Frontend still surfaces "No response was generated" on the second message; UI fails to render streamed assistant delta even though backend logs `[STREAM][finish]` and persists history.
- Need to trace `useChat` stream parsing after metadata changes and confirm we attach listener to the `text` channel emitted by Vercel AI SDK.
- No further deployments yet; once parsing fix is ready, rerun streaming flow tests before shipping.
