## Startup Routine Verification (—)

**Status**: ✅ Daily startup checks completed; context verified and devlog initialized

**Context**: Executed CLAUDE.md startup routine to ensure environment, documentation, and design system are aligned before development.

**Changes Made**
- Created devlog: `updates/2025-10-14_devlog.md`
- Reviewed architecture: `README.md` (active app at `ea-ai-main2/ea-ai-main2`, React 19 + TS + Convex + Anthropic/OpenRouter)
- Read design system completely:
  - `ea-ai-main2/ea-ai-main2/src/index.css` (Tailwind v4 `@theme`, ChatGPT-style dark theme, typography/spacing/radius tokens, utilities/components)
  - `ea-ai-main2/ea-ai-main2/postcss.config.js` (uses `@tailwindcss/postcss`)
- Verified project structure: top-level dirs present; `updates/` and `personal/someday/` available
- Reviewed someday tasks: `personal/someday/todolist.md` (AgentDeskAI MCP gated on paying users; requires security audit first)

**Result**: Project state confirmed and ready for work; no code changes required today for startup. Security-sensitive tooling deferred until user metrics indicate paying users.
 
## Privacy Policy compliance + tab title tweak (—)

**Status**: ✅ Google policy-compliant privacy updates; minimal vendor disclosure; tab title displays correctly

**Context**: Needed to align our Privacy Policy with Google API Services User Data Policy (Limited Use) while avoiding internal vendor/model exposure, and include a small UI fix for the browser tab title.

**Changes Made**
- `ea-ai-main2/ea-ai-main2/src/views/PrivacyPolicy.tsx`:
  - Added explicit scopes list under Section 5: `calendar.events`, `calendar.readonly`, `calendar.settings.readonly`.
  - Added Limited Use commitments, Data Handling & Storage (no event content persisted; tokens only), Subprocessors (generic), and Transfers in Business Transactions (consent required).
  - Removed Sections 6–11 and 13; renumbered TOC and headers; updated "Last Updated" date.
- `ea-ai-main2/ea-ai-main2/index.html`:
  - Fixed tab title to display the correct app name consistently.

**Result**: Privacy Policy now satisfies Google’s disclosure and Limited Use requirements without exposing internal providers or models. Tab title renders properly across routes.
