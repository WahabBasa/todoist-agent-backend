# Development Log - September 28, 2025

## Session Start
- **Time**: 6:42 AM
- **Context**: Starting new development session

## Tasks and Progress

### ✅ Retry Button Implementation for Rate Limiting
- **Objective**: Add retry functionality when LLM fails to respond due to rate limiting
- **Approach**: Custom implementation adapted for Convex backend (not standard Vercel AI SDK)

**Implementation Details:**
1. **Enhanced useConvexChat Hook** (`src/hooks/useConvexChat.ts`)
   - Added `lastFailedMessage` state to track failed requests
   - Modified `reload()` function to actually retry instead of just clearing errors
   - Store failed message content for later retry attempts

2. **Updated Chat Context** (`src/context/chat.tsx`)
   - Added `reload` function to ChatContextType interface
   - Exposed reload function through context for component access

3. **Added Retry Button** (`src/components/chat/ConversationTurn.tsx`)
   - Added RotateCcw icon import for retry button UI
   - Enhanced props interface with `error` and `onRetry` parameters
   - Implemented conditional retry button logic:
     - Shows only on last conversation turn
     - Only when error exists and no AI response
     - Hidden during loading/thinking states

4. **Connected Components** (`src/components/chat/Chat.tsx`)
   - Updated Chat component to pass error state and reload function
   - Established full data flow: Context → Chat → ConversationTurn → Retry Button

## Issues Encountered

### Analysis of Morphic Reference Implementation
- **Issue**: Initial digest suggested following Morphic's complex architecture
- **Reality**: Morphic uses sophisticated message parts system with AnswerSection/MessageActions
- **Our Project**: Simpler ConversationTurn-based architecture with custom Convex backend
- **Solution**: Adapted retry pattern to our existing architecture instead of copying Morphic

### Backend Architecture Differences
- **Issue**: Digest assumed standard Vercel AI SDK with streaming
- **Reality**: Custom Convex implementation with action calls, no streaming
- **Solution**: Custom retry logic that works with our Convex backend patterns

## Solutions and Fixes

### Rate Limiting Retry Flow
1. **Failure Detection**: API call fails → error state set → user message removed → `lastFailedMessage` stored
2. **User Interface**: Error message displayed with "Retry" button on last conversation turn
3. **Retry Logic**: `reload()` function re-attempts exact same failed message
4. **Clean State**: Error cleared and message sent through normal flow

### TypeScript Compatibility
- All components properly typed with enhanced interfaces
- No TypeScript compilation errors during implementation
- Maintained existing type safety standards

## Notes and Observations

### Key Design Decisions
- **Minimal Architecture Changes**: Worked within existing component structure
- **Error-State Driven**: Retry appears based on actual failure conditions
- **Last Message Only**: Retry only available on most recent failed attempt
- **Convex-Compatible**: Built for custom backend, not standard AI SDK patterns

### Code Quality
- Clean separation of concerns between hook, context, and components
- Proper error handling and state management
- Accessible UI with proper ARIA labels for retry button

## Next Steps

### Testing Required
- [ ] Test retry functionality with actual rate limiting scenarios
- [ ] Verify error message display and button appearance
- [ ] Test retry success flow and state cleanup
- [ ] Validate TypeScript compilation in production build

### Potential Enhancements
- Consider adding retry attempt counter to prevent infinite retries
- Add loading state during retry attempt
- Consider exponential backoff for repeated failures

## Session 2: Prompt System Fixes
- **Time**: 7:00 AM
- **Context**: Fixing AI behavior issues with user information collection

### ✅ Removed "People Involved" Questions from AI Prompts

**Problem**: AI was asking users about "who is involved" or dependencies despite being designed to only ask about timing and duration.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **zen_new.ts**: Contains delegation instructions that included "then involved parties" 
2. **taskTool.ts**: Tool description instructed information-collector to ask about "involved" people
3. **internal.ts**: Examples mentioned "Worry" in addition to timing/duration

**Files Modified:**
1. **convex/ai/prompts/zen_new.ts** (Lines 50, 52, 89)
   - Removed "then involved parties" from all delegation instructions
   - Changed pattern from "deadline first, then time duration, then involved parties" 
   - To: "deadline first, then time duration in separate turns"

2. **convex/ai/tools/taskTool.ts** (Line 41)  
   - Removed "then involved" from information-collector description
   - Changed from: "deadline first, then time duration, then involved"
   - To: "deadline first, then time duration"

3. **convex/ai/tools/internal.ts** (Lines 97-99)
   - Removed "Worry" from example todo content
   - Simplified to only "Deadline, Time Duration" pattern

**Verification**: Confirmed information_collector_new.ts only focuses on 2 details (timing + duration) as intended.

### ✅ Fixed Information Collection Flow Transitions

**Problem**: Poor transitions between tasks during information collection - AI would jump from duration of one task directly to duration of another, skipping deadline questions and proper acknowledgments.

**Example of Bad Behavior:**
```
User: "Maybe 3-4 hours total..."
AI: "How long do you estimate outlining the work presentation will take?" ❌
```

**Solution Implemented:**
Enhanced **convex/ai/prompts/information_collector_new.ts** with:

1. **Updated Conversation Flow** (Lines 56-65):
   - Added explicit 4-step pattern: Pick task → Get timing → Get duration → Brief acknowledgment → Move to next task
   - Clear transition guidance: "After getting duration: 'Got it. When is [next task] due?'"

2. **New Transition Rules Section** (Lines 68-82):
   - Specific examples of proper acknowledgments
   - Clear "NEVER DO" rules including "Skip the deadline question for new tasks"
   - Examples: "Got it. When is your work presentation due?"

3. **Enhanced Multi-Task Example** (Lines 84-112):
   - Replaced simple 2-task example with comprehensive 3-task flow
   - Shows proper transitions: Duration → "Got it. When do you need to [next task]?"
   - Demonstrates variety in acknowledgments: "Got it", "Cool", "Perfect"

**Expected Fixed Behavior:**
```
User: "Maybe 3-4 hours total..."
AI: "Got it. When is your work presentation due?" ✅
User: "Friday afternoon."
AI: "How long will outlining it take?" ✅
```

### Impact Summary
- **User Experience**: AI now properly acknowledges responses and follows logical question sequences
- **Information Quality**: Maintains focus on only timing and duration (no people/dependency questions)
- **Conversation Flow**: Natural, warm transitions between tasks with brief acknowledgments

### Code Quality
- All changes maintain existing architecture patterns
- No breaking changes to tool interfaces or schema
- Preserved backward compatibility with existing conversations

## Session 3: Prompt System Conflict Resolution
- **Time**: 7:28 AM
- **Context**: Fixed AI transition issues that prevented proper deadline → duration → next task flow

### ✅ Resolved Conflicting Prompt Injections

**Problem**: AI wasn't transitioning properly between tasks, jumping from duration of one task directly to duration of another, skipping deadline questions.

**Root Cause**: Three conflicting prompt sources were overriding each other:
1. ✅ **Correct**: `information_collector_new.ts` - Proper deadline → duration → next task pattern
2. ⚠️ **Generic**: `modes/registry.ts` - Basic injection lacking specific flow guidance
3. ❌ **Conflicting**: `taskTool.ts` - "SINGLE-QUESTION ENFORCEMENT" override that broke transitions

**Example of Bad Behavior Fixed:**
```
User: "Maybe 3-4 hours total..."
AI: "How long do you think outlining the work presentation will take?" ❌
```

**Files Modified:**

1. **convex/ai/tools/taskTool.ts** (Lines 98-103)
   - **Removed**: Problematic `refinedPrompt` override with "CRITICAL SINGLE-QUESTION ENFORCEMENT"
   - **Impact**: Eliminated conflicting instructions that prevented task transitions
   - **Change**: `let refinedPrompt = prompt; if (targetType === "primary-mode"...)` → `const refinedPrompt = prompt;`

2. **convex/ai/modes/registry.ts** (Line 128)
   - **Updated**: Generic prompt injection with specific flow instructions
   - **From**: "Have natural, friendly conversations to understand what the user needs..."
   - **To**: "Follow the deadline-first pattern: for each task, ask about timing/deadline first, then ask about duration, then acknowledge and move to the next task's timing"

**Expected Fixed Behavior:**
```
User: "Maybe 3-4 hours total..."
AI: "Got it. When is your work presentation due?" ✅
User: "Friday afternoon."
AI: "How long will outlining it take?" ✅
```

### Remaining Issues Identified (Not Fixed)

**Question Monotony**: AI uses same exact question styles with no word variations
- Same phrasing patterns repeated ("When's this due?", "How long will that take?")
- Overuses "deadline" terminology for all timing questions
- Repetitive "how much time" phrasing

**Next Steps**: Address question variety and natural language variation in future session

### Technical Impact
- Removed conflicting prompt override that broke information collection flow
- Aligned registry injection with correct transition pattern from information_collector_new.ts
- Maintained all existing architecture and tool interfaces
- No breaking changes to conversation handling or mode switching

## Session 4: Information Collection → Planning Mode Rebranding
- **Time**: 8:25 PM
- **Context**: Rebranding information-collector mode to planning mode and implementing intelligent mode switching

### ✅ Completed Mode System Overhaul

**Problem**: System had conflicting mode purposes and outdated information-collector mode that needed to become a comprehensive planning mode.

**Changes Made:**

1. **Mode Registry Restructure** (`convex/ai/modes/registry.ts`)
   - Renamed `information-collector` → `planning` mode
   - Updated PrimaryModeType enum to remove information-collector
   - Updated all method references and validation logic
   - Enhanced tool restrictions to allow delegation to execution agent only

2. **New Planning Mode Implementation** (`convex/ai/prompts/planning_new.ts`)
   - Replaced rigid Eisenhower Matrix prompt with flexible planning assistance
   - Implemented max 2 questions per response rule
   - Added simple, conversational language requirements
   - Enabled AI judgment for determining important questions about deadlines/timing
   - Made planning applicable to any type of user request (work, personal, events, etc.)

3. **Planning Subagent Disabled** (`convex/ai/tools/simpleDelegation.ts`)
   - Commented out planTask delegation tool
   - Planning now handled in primary mode conversation context

4. **TypeScript Error Resolution** (`convex/chatSessions.ts`)
   - Fixed mutation args type mismatch from information-collector → planning

5. **System Reference Updates**
   - Updated `convex/ai/tools/taskTool.ts` mode validation and descriptions
   - Updated `convex/ai/tools/switchModeTool.ts` mode examples
   - Updated `convex/schema.ts` primary mode types
   - Updated `convex/ai/session.ts` targetName references and context filtering
   - Enhanced task pattern matching for better context extraction

6. **Intelligent Mode Switching Implementation** (`convex/ai/prompts/zen_new.ts`)
   - Removed rigid keyword-matching patterns for brain dump detection
   - Implemented intelligent switchMode tool usage with AI discretion
   - Updated examples to show switchMode with reasoning instead of hardcoded patterns
   - Enhanced overwhelmed user handling to use flexible planning approach

### Key Architecture Changes
- **Information Collection Mode**: Eliminated (functionality absorbed into planning mode)
- **Planning Mode**: Now handles flexible planning for any user needs with AI judgment
- **Mode Switching**: Changed from rigid pattern matching to intelligent tool-based switching
- **Prompt Injection**: Updated session.ts to apply context filtering to planning mode instead of information-collector
