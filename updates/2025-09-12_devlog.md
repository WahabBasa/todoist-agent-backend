## Activities

## Playwright MCP Server Setup - Web Automation Integration
**Date**: September 12, 2025 - 8:30 AM - Development Setup  
**Status**: ✅ Successfully installed and connected

Researched and implemented Playwright MCP server based on Microsoft's official implementation. Analysis of multiple available MCP servers led me to choose the official @playwright/mcp package for reliability and active maintenance.

**Decision Process**: Evaluated three main options:
1. Microsoft's official @playwright/mcp (chosen for reliability)  
2. ExecuteAutomation's community version (more features but third-party)
3. Manual setup (unnecessary complexity for basic automation needs)

**Implementation**: Used Claude Code's native MCP integration via `claude mcp add playwright npx -- @playwright/mcp@latest`. This approach ensures proper configuration management and automatic health checking.

**Current Status**: All MCP servers healthy and connected:
- context7: Documentation lookup (✓ Connected)
- todoist: Task management (✓ Connected)  
- playwright: Browser automation (✓ Connected)

**Key Capabilities Gained**: Fast browser automation without vision models, structured web interaction via accessibility tree, deterministic tool application, and support for Chromium/Firefox/WebKit engines.

**Technical Notes**: Playwright MCP uses accessibility tree parsing instead of visual models, making it faster and more reliable for automated browser tasks. Supports Node.js 18+ requirement already met in development environment.

## Chat Interface Redesign - Professional UI Enhancement
**Date**: September 12, 2025 - 9:30 AM - UI Development  
**Status**: ✅ Tested and working

Completed comprehensive UI redesign to match Claude's professional interface standards based on user feedback comparing current implementation to Claude reference interface.

**Problem Analysis**: Current interface suffered from cramped layout, poor visual hierarchy, and readability issues:
- Sidebar too narrow (288px) causing chat title truncation
- AI messages cluttered with background containers 
- Greeting text too small and unwelcoming
- Inconsistent sidebar alignment and thin typography

**Implementation Strategy**: Applied systematic UI enhancement approach using existing design system:

**Phase 1 - Layout Proportions**:
- Increased sidebar width from `w-72` (288px) to `w-80` (320px) in `CollapsibleSidebar.tsx:82`
- Adjusted chat container responsive widths from 768px/800px to 740px/760px in `Chat.tsx`
- Removed AI message background containers (`bg-background/50`) in `ConversationTurn.tsx:71`
- Increased conversation spacing from `gap-6` to `gap-8` for better breathing room

**Phase 2 - Visual Organization**:
- Eliminated excessive borders causing visual fragmentation across sidebar sections
- Standardized spacing to consistent `p-4` padding throughout sidebar components
- Changed "Recent Chats" to "Recents" with better `text-muted-foreground` typography
- Cleaned header by removing unnecessary borders around toggle button

**Phase 3 - Typography & Alignment**:
- Enhanced greeting from `text-sm` to `text-base font-medium text-foreground` in `ChatGreeting.tsx:8`
- Fixed sidebar alignment by updating `SidebarMenuItem` padding from `px-3` to `px-4`
- Strengthened chat history typography from `text-secondary` to `font-semibold text-foreground`
- Replaced verbose welcome message with minimal "How can I help you today?"

**Current Status**: Interface now matches professional standards with balanced proportions, consistent alignment, and proper visual hierarchy. Chat titles fully readable, clean message presentation, and welcoming initial experience.

**Technical Decisions**: 
- Maintained existing design system variables while applying them more consistently
- Preserved functionality while removing visual clutter
- Used semantic spacing and typography scales from established theme
- Applied mobile-responsive patterns throughout changes

**Files Modified**: `CollapsibleSidebar.tsx`, `Chat.tsx`, `ConversationTurn.tsx`, `ChatGreeting.tsx`, `ChatHistory.tsx` - all changes maintain backward compatibility and existing functionality.
