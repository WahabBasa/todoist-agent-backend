## JavaScript Syntax Fix - SettingsView Component
**Date**: August 27, 2025 - 12:30 AM - Bug Fix Session
**Status**: ✅ Tested and working

Analyzed and resolved a critical JavaScript syntax error in SettingsView.tsx that was preventing compilation. The issue was an extra closing brace at line 693 that broke the `try-catch-finally` block structure in the Google Calendar OAuth connection logic.

**Problem Analysis**: Babel parser encountered unexpected token `}` before the `finally` block, indicating mismatched brace structure. Made the call to examine the specific area around the error rather than attempting broader debugging approaches - this targeted analysis immediately revealed the root cause.

**Engineering Decision**: Chose the surgical approach - removed only the specific extra brace without restructuring the surrounding code. The existing error handling logic for Google Calendar OAuth was comprehensive and well-structured, so preserving that complexity was the right trade-off vs. simplification.

**Implementation**: Fixed by removing the duplicate closing brace at line 693, ensuring proper `try-catch-finally` syntax:
- Before: `} catch (error) { ... } } finally {`  (broken)
- After: `} catch (error) { ... } finally {`     (correct)

**Current Status**: Syntax error resolved, Convex functions loaded successfully, development server running without compilation errors. Google Calendar and Todoist OAuth integrations remain functional with proper error handling intact.

**Engineering Insight**: Sometimes the quickest path to resolution is the most direct one. Complex OAuth integration code with extensive logging can be fragile to syntax errors, but the underlying logic was sound - just needed the brace mismatch correction.

## Key Activities
- Fixed JavaScript syntax error in SettingsView.tsx
- Validated try-catch-finally block structure
- Confirmed development server compilation success

## Issues Encountered
- Extra closing brace breaking try-catch-finally syntax at line 693

## Lessons Learned
- Targeted analysis of specific error locations often more effective than broad debugging
- Preserve existing comprehensive error handling when fixing syntax issues
- Babel parsing errors typically indicate precise structural issues
