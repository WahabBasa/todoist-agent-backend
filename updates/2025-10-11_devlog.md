## Tailark Integration - Professional Landing & Privacy Pages

**Status**: ✅ Complete - Production-ready landing page with professional UI blocks

Replaced basic landing page with Tailark FREE shadcn blocks for professional marketing site appearance.

### Changes Made

**Tailark Registry Setup** (`ea-ai-main2/ea-ai-main2/components.json:20-23`)
Added Tailark registry for installing free marketing blocks via shadcn CLI.

**Landing Page Components**:
- `src/components/hero-section-adapted.tsx` - Professional hero with animated text, gradient backgrounds, CTA integration with CustomAuthForm
- `src/components/features-9-adapted.tsx` - Interactive features grid with dotted map, chat illustration, activity chart (recharts)
- `src/components/footer-adapted.tsx` - Clean footer with links to Privacy/Terms/Contact
- `src/components/header-adapted.tsx` - Sticky navigation bar with scroll effects, mobile hamburger menu

**Privacy Page** (`src/views/PrivacyPolicy.tsx:3-4, 40-41`)
Added consistent Tailark footer to privacy page.

**Styling** (`src/index.css:6-9`)
Added smooth scroll behavior for anchor navigation (`#features`, `#auth`).

**Dependencies**
Installed `dotted-map` package for geographic visualization in features section.

### Installed Blocks

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @tailark/hero-section-1
npx shadcn@latest add @tailark/features-9  
npx shadcn@latest add @tailark/footer-1
```

### Technical Notes

**Next.js → React Adaptation**: Tailark blocks use Next.js imports (Link, Image). Created `-adapted` versions replacing:
- `Link` → `<a>` tags
- `Image` → Removed (placeholder backgrounds)
- Customized content for TaskAI branding

**Header Behavior**:
- Fixed position with z-20
- Transforms on scroll (50px threshold): compact width, rounded corners, backdrop blur
- Mobile: Full-screen slide menu with hamburger icon
- Desktop: Horizontal nav with centered links

**Navigation**:
- Features → `#features` (scroll to section)
- Privacy → `/privacy` (route)
- Get Started → `#auth` (scroll to auth form)

### Result

Professional SaaS-style landing page with:
- Animated hero section with text effects
- Interactive features grid with visualizations
- Sticky responsive header with scroll effects
- Mobile-optimized hamburger menu
- Smooth scroll navigation
- Dark mode support (inherited from Tailark)
- Consistent footer across pages
