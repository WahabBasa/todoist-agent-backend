- Verified new tool-call persistence path: `appendAssistantMessage` now stores paired calls/results correctly and backend stream completes without conversion errors.
- Frontend still flashes transient "No response" error for tool-only answers despite successful hydration; temporary placeholder added but regression persists during live testing.
- Next steps: investigate UI status transitions and placeholder lifecycle to eliminate flicker before shipping fix.
