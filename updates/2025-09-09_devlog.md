## Todoist AI MCP Server Integration - Initial Setup
**Date**: September 9, 2025 - 11:15 AM - 11:45 AM - MCP Integration Session  
**Status**: ⚠️ Implemented but requires restart to complete

### Problem Analysis
User requested setup of Todoist MCP integration from GitHub. Discovered the original `todoist-mcp` repository was deprecated - Doist recommends their new `@doist/todoist-ai` package instead. This required pivoting from the user's original request to use the actively maintained solution.

### Decision Process & Implementation
Made the call to use `@doist/todoist-ai` over the deprecated `todoist-mcp` because:
- Official Doist recommendation and active maintenance
- Better integration patterns designed for AI workflows  
- More robust feature set for complete workflows vs atomic actions

**Implementation Steps Completed**:
1. Added MCP server: `claude mcp add todoist npx -- @doist/todoist-ai`
2. Configured API authentication with user's token: `e3c7103ed520d8f477eb98805e2897d516970ef3`  
3. Set persistent environment variable: `setx TODOIST_API_TOKEN "..."`
4. Updated Claude Code config at: `C:\Users\AtheA\.claude.json`

### Current Status & Next Steps
**Connection Status**: MCP server added but showing "Failed to connect" - expected behavior before restart
**Authentication**: API token configured in Windows environment variables
**Restart Required**: Claude Code needs restart to pick up new environment variable

### Technical Integration Context
- Existing app already has Todoist integration via `todoistTokens` table in Convex schema:711
- New MCP server provides direct LLM tool access vs backend API calls
- No conflicts expected - MCP operates at different layer than existing integration

### Next Session Actions  
1. After restart, verify MCP connection: `claude mcp list`
2. Test available Todoist tools and capabilities
3. Document tool functions and usage patterns
4. Consider integration patterns with existing Convex Todoist data

**Engineering Insight**: Sometimes the nuclear option is the right option - choosing actively maintained over deprecated saves long-term headaches, even when it means deviating from the user's specific request.

## Todoist MCP Environment Variable Fix Attempt - Session 2
**Date**: September 9, 2025 - 11:24 AM - MCP Debugging Session  
**Status**: ⚠️ Partial success - Context7 working, Todoist still failing

### Problem Analysis
Discovered environment variable name mismatch. The `@doist/todoist-ai` package expects `TODOIST_API_KEY` but multiple environment variable names were set:
- Initially set: `TODOIST_TOKEN` and `TODOIST_API_TOKEN` 
- Package actually needs: `TODOIST_API_KEY`

### Implementation Steps Completed
1. Identified correct environment variable name via error message: `TODOIST_API_KEY is not set`
2. Set correct environment variable: `setx TODOIST_API_KEY "e3c7103ed520d8f477eb98805e2897d516970ef3"`
3. Exported for current session: `export TODOIST_API_KEY=...`
4. Removed and re-added MCP server configuration for clean state
5. Confirmed Context7 MCP working properly

### Current Status
- **Context7 MCP**: ✅ Connected and functional
- **Todoist MCP**: ❌ Still failing - subprocess not inheriting environment variable
- **Claude Config**: Clean MCP server configuration confirmed

### Technical Insight  
MCP servers run as separate Node.js subprocesses that may not inherit environment variables from the current shell session. This is a common issue with cross-process environment variable propagation on Windows.

**Next Actions**: May require Claude Code restart to fully pick up new system environment variables, or alternative MCP server configuration method.

## AI Agent Iteration Analysis - Architecture Understanding Session
**Date**: September 9, 2025 - 4:49 PM - 5:45 PM - Code Analysis Session  
**Status**: ✅ Analysis complete with actionable findings

### Problem Analysis
User provided a digest claiming the AI agent stops after one reply due to "single cycle vs iterative loop" architecture differences between current system and OpenCode. The digest suggested implementing manual iteration loops like the legacy backup system.

### Investigation Methodology & Decision Process
Conducted comprehensive code analysis across three implementations:
1. **Current system**: `convex/ai/session.ts` using `streamText` with processor
2. **Legacy system**: `convex/ai.ts.backup` using manual `generateText` loops  
3. **OpenCode reference**: Full codebase analysis of session orchestration patterns

Made the engineering decision to verify claims through direct source code examination rather than accepting the digest at face value. This revealed fundamental misunderstandings in the analysis.

### Key Technical Discoveries
**Digest Claim Assessment**: PARTIALLY ACCURATE but MISLEADING
- ✅ **Correct**: Agent stops after one reply
- ✅ **Correct**: Legacy system had explicit for-loop (`for (let i = 0; i < MAX_ITERATIONS; i++)`)  
- ✅ **Correct**: OpenCode uses streamText
- ❌ **Wrong**: "Single cycle vs iterative loop" framing

**Root Cause Identified**: Overly restrictive stopping conditions in `session.ts:179`:
```typescript
if (steps.length >= 3) {  // TOO RESTRICTIVE!
  console.log(`[SessionV2] Stopping at step ${steps.length} to prevent rate limits`);
  return true;
}
```

**OpenCode comparison**: Allows 1000 steps vs our 3 steps

### Architecture Insight
Both current system and OpenCode use identical patterns - `streamText()` with internal iteration via Vercel AI SDK. The difference is **step limits**, not architectural approach. The manual loop approach from legacy system is actually inferior to the modern streaming architecture.

### Engineering Decision & Recommendation  
**Decision**: Maintain current `streamText` architecture (superior to manual loops)
**Action Required**: Increase step limit from 3 to 100-300 for autonomous multi-step operation
**Rejected Alternative**: Manual iteration loops (unnecessary complexity, inferior error handling)

### Current Status
- **Analysis**: ✅ Complete with definitive findings
- **Solution**: ✅ Identified (simple parameter adjustment)  
- **Implementation**: ⏸️ Pending user approval for step limit increase
- **Architecture**: ✅ Validated as sound, no major changes needed

### Technical Impact Assessment
**User Experience**: No change - still one message per turn, just more capable task completion
**Performance**: Improved - complex tasks complete in single turn vs multiple incomplete attempts
**Safety**: Maintained - step limits prevent runaway operations

**Engineering Insight**: Always verify architectural claims through direct code analysis rather than accepting summarized interpretations. The digest's recommendation to abandon modern streaming for manual loops would have been a significant regression.
