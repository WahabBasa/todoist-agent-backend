## Task Inbox Implementation - Schema Validation Blocking Testing

**Date**: August 16, 2025 - 8:45 AM - Frontend Feature Implementation
**Status**: ⚠️ Implementation complete but testing blocked by Convex schema validation failures

### Problem Analysis
User requested a Todoist-style inbox feature where tasks without assigned projects would appear in a centralized inbox view with quick task creation via floating modal. Implementation went smoothly but testing was completely blocked by legacy conversation data in Convex that doesn't match the current schema format. The old data uses fields like `message`, `response`, `timestamp` while the new schema expects a `messages` array structure.

### Engineering Decision Process
Made the strategic choice to implement the complete inbox feature first before testing, following the planned architecture. Built the backend query `getInboxTasks` to filter tasks without projectId, created the `QuickTaskModal` component with shadcn Dialog, and implemented the complete `InboxView` with empty states and floating action button. However, encountered an irreconcilable blocker where Convex refuses to start due to schema validation failures on legacy conversation records that can't be deleted through CLI tools.

### Implementation Approach
**Backend Implementation (convex/tasks.ts:310-341)**
- Added `getInboxTasks` query filtering tasks where `projectId` is null/undefined
- Sorts by creation time newest first, defaults to active tasks only
- Integrates seamlessly with existing task schema and authentication

**Frontend Architecture (App.tsx:41, Sidebar.tsx:46)**
- Updated main app routing to include "inbox" view type alongside existing views
- Modified sidebar navigation to show inbox with task count badge
- Maintained consistent navigation patterns and active state management

**Modal Component Design (QuickTaskModal.tsx)**
- Built with shadcn Dialog for proper overlay and accessibility
- Minimal form with title (required), description (optional), priority dropdown
- Auto-focus on title input, ESC to close, form validation with toast feedback
- Red Todoist-style submit button matching app's design language

**Inbox View Implementation (InboxView.tsx)**
- Clean header showing task count, empty state with call-to-action
- Task cards with checkboxes, priority badges, metadata (creation date, due date, time estimates)
- Floating action button (bottom-right) matching Todoist's UX pattern
- Responsive design with proper overflow handling and hover states

### Current Status
Complete feature implementation achieved with all components properly integrated. TypeScript compilation passes without errors. All file changes committed and ready for testing, but Convex deployment completely blocked by schema validation on legacy conversation data containing fields like `{message: "hi", response: "...", timestamp: 1753521053938.0, toolCalls: []}` instead of expected `{messages: [{role: "user", content: "...", timestamp: ...}]}` format.

### Engineering Insights
The schema validation blocker demonstrates the importance of data migration strategies when evolving database schemas. Attempted several approaches including making messages field optional, adding legacy field support, and creating cleanup functions, but none resolved the fundamental issue that Convex performs strict validation before allowing any deployments. The correct solution requires either manual deletion through the dashboard or a proper data migration script that runs before schema changes.

### Next Development Considerations
Feature is architecturally sound and ready for testing once schema issues are resolved. All shadcn components integrate properly with existing design system. The inbox concept aligns well with existing task management patterns and should provide the quick capture workflow requested.

**File Changes**: 
- `convex/tasks.ts` (added getInboxTasks query)
- `src/App.tsx` (added inbox routing)
- `src/components/Sidebar.tsx` (added inbox navigation)  
- `src/components/QuickTaskModal.tsx` (new modal component)
- `src/views/InboxView.tsx` (new inbox view)
- `convex/cleanup.ts` (temporary cleanup function, unused)
