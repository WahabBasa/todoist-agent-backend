# DevLog - September 23, 2025

## Session Start
- **Time**: 07:55 AM
- **Focus**: Model selection fix verification and documentation

## Activities

### ✅ **Model Selection Fix Verification - SUCCESS**
**Time**: 08:00 AM
**Issue**: Model ID parsing was incorrectly splitting model IDs and only passing the second part to OpenRouter API

**Fix Verification**:
- Model ID `x-ai/grok-4-fast:free` is now correctly passed to OpenRouter without parsing
- System logs show: `Using full model ID: { modelId: 'x-ai/grok-4-fast:free' }`
- Successful responses generated: "Hello! How can I help?", "Let's start with your work deadlines..."
- Token usage properly tracked: 5300 tokens, 5906 tokens

**Files Modified**:
- `ea-ai-main2/ea-ai-main2/convex/ai/session.ts` - Fixed model ID parsing logic

### ⚠️ **New Issue Identified: Rate Limiting**
**Time**: 08:05 AM
**Issue**: Provider-level rate limiting (429 error) for `qwen/qwen3-coder:free` model

**Error Details**:
```
"qwen/qwen3-coder:free is temporarily rate-limited upstream. Please retry shortly, or add your own key to accumulate your rate limits"
```

**Analysis**:
- This is a provider-side issue, not a code problem
- Common with free-tier models on OpenRouter
- Solutions: Wait and retry, use different model, or add personal API key

### 📝 **Documentation Updates**
**Time**: 08:10 AM
- Updated devlog with fix verification
- Documented rate limiting issue as separate concern
- Added commit message for changes

## Next Steps
1. Monitor model selection behavior with other models
2. Investigate rate limiting solutions if it persists
3. Test with user's personal OpenRouter API key
