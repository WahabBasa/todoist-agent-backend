## Cleanup Task - Removed Unused Files

**Date**: September 19, 2025 - 10:30 AM - Cleanup Session
**Status**: ✅ Tested and working

### Summary
Removed unused/backup files from the codebase to reduce clutter:
1. Deleted enhanced planning agent and all related files
2. Removed non-code files from prompts directory
3. Removed backup and documentation files from ai directory

### Files Removed
- Enhanced planning agent files:
  - enhancedPlanningTest.ts
  - enhancedPlanningExample.md (references)
  - Related documentation references

- Non-code files from prompts directory:
  - CHANGES_SUMMARY.md
  - FINAL_SUMMARY.md
  - TEST_PLAN.md

- Backup/documentation files from ai directory:
  - messageV2Complex.ts.backup
  - processorComplex.ts.backup
  - sessionComplex.ts.backup
  - toolRegistryComplex.ts.backup
  - PROMPT_ALIGNMENT_SUMMARY.md
  - SIMPLIFICATION_SUMMARY.md
  - SYSTEM_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md

### Verification
All remaining files are properly referenced in the codebase. System functionality unchanged.

## 4-Mode Architecture Implementation

**Date**: September 19, 2025 - 7:15 PM - Architecture Update
**Status**: ⚠️ Implemented but communication style degraded

### Summary
Implemented complete 4-mode architecture with automatic agent switching:
1. **Primary (Orchestrator)**: Workflow coordination and automatic delegation
2. **Information Collector**: Systematic information gathering with internal todolist
3. **Planning**: Pure strategic planning from complete information
4. **Execution**: Direct task and calendar operations

### Key Changes Made

#### Agent Registry Updates (`convex/ai/agents/registry.ts`)
- Added `information-collector` agent configuration
- Updated Primary agent to orchestrator-only (removed direct execution tools)
- Refined Planning agent to remove information gathering tools
- Implemented proper tool filtering for each agent mode

#### Automatic Mode Switching (`convex/ai/session.ts`)
- Added intelligent agent determination based on request analysis
- Implemented session state management with agentName tracking
- Added pattern matching for automatic routing:
  - Direct execution → execution agent
  - Information needs → information-collector agent  
  - Planning needs → planning agent
  - Complex operations → primary orchestrator

#### Agent-Specific System Prompts (`convex/ai/prompts/system.ts`)
- Created specialized prompts for each agent mode
- Implemented agent-specific prompt selection
- Added fallback handling for unknown agents

#### Session Management (`convex/chatSessions.ts`)
- Added agentName field to updateChatSession mutation
- Enabled dynamic agent switching during conversations

### Technical Implementation
- **Pattern Recognition**: Regex-based request analysis for automatic routing
- **Tool Filtering**: Agent-specific tool permissions enforced at registry level
- **State Management**: Session-based agent persistence with intelligent fallbacks
- **Prompt Selection**: Dynamic system prompt generation based on active agent

### Issues Identified
❌ **Communication Style Degraded**: System became verbose and lost single-entity conversation flow
❌ **Lost Conversational Principles**: No longer asking one thing at a time
❌ **Verbose Responses**: Agents responding with technical details instead of natural conversation

### Architecture Benefits (When Working)
✅ **Separation of Concerns**: Each agent has clear, focused responsibility
✅ **Automatic Workflow**: Users don't need to think about modes
✅ **Systematic Processing**: Information gathering, planning, execution workflow
✅ **Scalable Design**: Easy to add new specialized agents

### Next Steps
- Communication style needs restoration
- Conversational principles need reinforcement
- May need to simplify agent coordination to maintain natural flow
