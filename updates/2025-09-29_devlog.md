## Information-Collector to Planning Mode Transformation & Pattern Fixes

### Summary
Completed major transformation removing the information-collector mode and fixing robotic numbered conversation patterns. Also improved retry button functionality for rate limit errors.

### Key Changes

#### 1. Mode System Transformation
- **Deleted**: `convex/ai/prompts/information_collector_new.ts` (was causing robotic patterns)
- **Updated**: All mode references to use "planning" instead of "information-collector"
- **Fixed**: Schema, session handlers, and prompt loader to remove information-collector mode

#### 2. Conversation Pattern Fixes
- **Problem**: AI was producing robotic numbered questions like "To prioritize effectively, a couple quick questions: 1. 2."
- **Root Cause**: Old information_collector_new.ts prompt was still being loaded despite new planning prompts
- **Solution**: Removed numbered list patterns across all prompt files:
  - `zen_new.ts`: Converted numbered examples to bullet points
  - `toolUseGuidelines.ts`: Removed numbered workflow patterns
  - `execution_new.ts`: Converted numbered behaviors to natural descriptions
  - `planning_new.ts`: Complete rewrite for natural conversation flow

#### 3. Enhanced Retry Button for Rate Limits
- **Problem**: Rate limit errors (HTTP 429) weren't showing retry button
- **Root Cause**: Backend was returning errors as successful responses with metadata
- **Solution**:
  - Added `isRetriable` detection in `convex/ai/session.ts`
  - Enhanced error handling in `src/hooks/useConvexChat.ts` to detect backend error responses
  - Added `isRetriable?: boolean` to ChatMetadata interface

#### 4. Temperature Adjustment
- **Increased**: AI temperature from 0.4 to 0.6 in mode registry for more natural conversation
- **Goal**: Less robotic, more conversational responses while maintaining functionality

### Files Modified

#### Backend Changes
- `convex/schema.ts`: Removed information-collector from mode type union
- `convex/chatSessions.ts`: Updated all modeType unions to remove information-collector
- `convex/ai/system.ts`: Removed information-collector from mode prompt mapping
- `convex/ai/session.ts`:
  - Fixed error handling for retry button functionality
  - Updated comments to reference planning mode instead
- `convex/ai/modes/registry.ts`: Increased temperature to 0.6, updated prompt injection
- `convex/ai/prompts/promptLoader.ts`: Removed information_collector_new import and registry entries

#### Prompt System Overhaul
- `convex/ai/prompts/planning_new.ts`: Complete rewrite for natural conversation
- `convex/ai/prompts/zen_new.ts`: Fixed numbered patterns, improved examples
- `convex/ai/prompts/execution_new.ts`: Converted to natural language descriptions
- `convex/ai/prompts/sections/toolUseGuidelines.ts`: Removed numbered workflow patterns
- `convex/ai/prompts/sections/modes.ts`: Updated mode documentation

#### Frontend Changes
- `src/hooks/useConvexChat.ts`: Enhanced error detection for response metadata
- `src/components/chat/Chat.tsx`: Improved retry button state management
- `src/components/chat/ConversationTurn.tsx`: Better error display handling
- `src/context/chat.tsx`: Enhanced error state management

### Technical Details

#### TypeScript Error Resolution
- **Error**: `Cannot find module './information_collector_new'`
- **Fix**: Removed import and registry references from promptLoader.ts

#### Mode Switching Logic
- Primary mode can delegate to any subagent
- Planning mode can delegate to execution subagent only
- All information-collector references now route to planning mode

#### Error Handling Flow
1. Backend detects rate limit (HTTP 429)
2. Sets `isRetriable: true` in response metadata
3. Frontend detects error in metadata and enables retry button
4. User can retry the same request

### Testing Status
- ✅ TypeScript compilation fixed
- ⏳ Runtime testing pending
- ⏳ User interaction flow testing pending

### Next Steps
1. Test the transformed planning mode in real conversations
2. Verify retry button works for rate limit scenarios
3. Monitor for any remaining robotic patterns
4. Consider user feedback on the more natural conversation flow

### Lessons Learned
- Multiple prompt files can create conflicting behavior patterns
- File-based prompt loading requires careful registry management
- Error handling flows need end-to-end consideration (backend → frontend)
- Natural conversation requires both content and structural changes

## Second Round: Methodology Explanation Fixes

### Summary
Additional prompt fixes to eliminate AI methodology explanations and improve follow-up questions for scheduling timing.

### Key Issues Addressed

#### 1. Methodology Explanation Removal
- **Problem**: AI still saying "Based on what you shared, here's a prioritized plan using urgency and importance (Eisenhower style)"
- **Root Cause**: Planning prompt contained language encouraging method explanations
- **Solution**: Removed specific lines causing methodology mentions:
  - Deleted: "Make it clear you're analyzing timing and consequences"
  - Changed: "Explain you're helping them figure out what to tackle first" → "Help them figure out what to tackle first"

#### 2. Explicit Method Prohibition
- **Added**: New "NEVER EXPLAIN" section in planning_new.ts
- **Prohibited**: Methods, approaches, analysis explanations (e.g., "Eisenhower style", "urgency and importance")
- **Updated**: AVOID examples with specific forbidden phrases

#### 3. Follow-up Question Requirements
- **Problem**: AI not asking when to schedule things (car registration timing, move specific time)
- **Solution**:
  - Added requirement to ask "When to schedule tasks (not just deadlines, but actual scheduling timing)"
  - Updated conversation flow to "Must ask about scheduling timing"
  - Enhanced examples to show proper scheduling follow-up questions

#### 4. Cross-File Consistency
- **Updated**: All references to "Eisenhower Matrix" → "priority and urgency principles"
- **Files**: registry.ts, rules.ts, capabilities.ts, toolUseGuidelines.ts
- **Goal**: Consistent terminology that doesn't encourage methodology explanations

### Files Modified (Second Round)

#### Core Prompt Files
- `convex/ai/prompts/planning_new.ts`:
  - Removed method explanation triggers
  - Added explicit "NEVER EXPLAIN" rules
  - Enhanced follow-up question requirements
  - Updated examples with scheduling questions
- `convex/ai/modes/registry.ts`: Updated description to remove "Eisenhower Matrix"

#### Supporting Prompt Sections
- `convex/ai/prompts/sections/rules.ts`: Updated methodology references
- `convex/ai/prompts/sections/capabilities.ts`: Updated methodology references
- `convex/ai/prompts/sections/toolUseGuidelines.ts`: Updated methodology references

### Expected Improvements
- ✅ No more "Eisenhower style" or methodology explanations
- ✅ Natural follow-up questions about scheduling timing
- ✅ AI asks "when should we schedule X" not just "when is X due"
- ✅ Consistent terminology across all prompt files

### Investigation Notes
- **Critical Issue**: AI still using forbidden phrases from AVOID examples
- **Next Steps**: Investigate prompt loading mechanism and potential caching issues
- **User Feedback**: Need initial plan first, then follow-up questions about scheduling

### Commit Information
- **Branch**: continue-work-2025-09-27
- **Files Modified**: 23 files total (18 initial + 5 additional)
- **Key Deletion**: information_collector_new.ts
- **Major Focus**: Natural conversation patterns, error handling, and methodology explanation removal

## Third Round: RooCode Architecture Implementation

### Summary
Comprehensive system refactoring based on RooCode digest analysis to implement better architectural separation between LLM decision-making and application execution, while reducing cognitive load and improving model consistency.

### Key Architectural Changes

#### 1. New Tool-Based Decision Architecture
- **Created**: `convex/ai/tools/evaluateUserResponseTool.ts` - Structured LLM decision-making
- **Created**: `convex/ai/tools/askClarifyingQuestionTool.ts` - Smart user interaction with question grouping
- **Principle**: LLM decides, application executes (inspired by RooCode's approach)

#### 2. Prompt Simplification & Cognitive Load Reduction
- **Zen Mode**: Removed 47+ behavioral rules, eliminated artificial character limits
- **Planning Mode**: Replaced negative constraints with positive guidance, integrated smart questioning
- **Execution Mode**: Streamlined to focus on direct action without artificial constraints
- **Goal**: Allow model to be naturally helpful while tools handle complexity

#### 3. Enhanced Mode Controller
- **Added**: `executeUserResponseDecision()` function for deterministic application-layer execution
- **Enhanced**: Database persistence with proper error handling
- **Improved**: State management separation between LLM reasoning and system execution

#### 4. Tool Registry Integration
- **Updated**: `convex/ai/toolRegistry.ts` to include new decision and interaction tools
- **Enhanced**: Mode permissions in `convex/ai/modes/registry.ts` for primary and planning modes
- **Result**: Seamless integration of new architectural components

### Architectural Principles Applied

#### From RooCode Analysis:
1. **Tool-Based User Interaction**: Move conversational rules from prompts to explicit tools
2. **Application-Controlled State**: LLM expresses decisions, app handles execution
3. **Cognitive Load Reduction**: Focus prompts on capabilities, not behavioral restrictions
4. **Smart Information Flow**: Intelligent question grouping (2-4 related questions) without overwhelming users

#### Key Improvements:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Decision-making vs execution clearly separated
- **Natural Communication**: Removed artificial constraints like character limits
- **Reliable State Transitions**: Deterministic application-controlled workflow
- **Maintained Autonomy**: LLM still makes intelligent decisions about user needs

### Files Modified (Third Round)

#### New Tool Creation
- `convex/ai/tools/evaluateUserResponseTool.ts`: Structured LLM decision-making
- `convex/ai/tools/askClarifyingQuestionTool.ts`: Smart user interaction

#### Core Prompt Overhaul
- `convex/ai/prompts/zen_new.ts`: Complete simplification (removed 106 lines of cognitive load)
- `convex/ai/prompts/planning_new.ts`: Refocused on productivity planning vs work consultation
- `convex/ai/prompts/execution_new.ts`: Streamlined for direct action confirmation

#### Architecture Enhancement
- `convex/ai/modes/controller.ts`: Added decision execution capabilities
- `convex/ai/toolRegistry.ts`: Integrated new tools
- `convex/ai/modes/registry.ts`: Updated tool permissions

### Technical Validation

#### TypeScript Issues Resolved
- **Problem**: Implicit `any` types in callback functions
- **Solution**: Added proper type interfaces for `SuggestedAnswer` and `FormattedSuggestion`
- **Result**: Clean TypeScript compilation with `npx tsc --noEmit`

#### Focus Refinement
- **Problem**: AI acting as technical consultant instead of productivity assistant
- **Solution**: Updated planning prompt to focus on scheduling/tool integration only
- **Result**: Questions about "when to schedule" not "how to implement"

### Expected Outcomes

#### Model Behavior Improvements:
- **Reduced cognitive load** → more consistent responses
- **Tool-based complexity** → cleaner conversation flow
- **Smart information gathering** → efficient question grouping
- **Natural communication** → no artificial constraints

#### Architectural Benefits:

- **Scalable tool integration** for future enhancements

### Testing Status
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- ✅ All tools properly integrated in registry
- ✅ Mode permissions correctly configured
- ⏳ Runtime behavior testing pending
- ⏳ User interaction flow validation pending

### Next Steps
1. Test new architecture with real user interactions
2. Validate that planning mode stays focused on productivity vs technical consultation
3. Monitor model consistency with reduced cognitive load
4. Gather feedback on smart question grouping effectiveness

### Lessons Learned from RooCode Analysis
- **Prompts should focus on capabilities, not restrictions** - Positive guidance works better than negative constraints
- **Tool-based interaction is more reliable** - Explicit tools vs embedded conversational rules
- **Application layer should handle state** - LLM reasoning + deterministic execution = better results

- **Major Addition**: RooCode-inspired architecture with tool-based decision making
- **Key Focus**: Architectural separation, cognitive load reduction, and productivity-focused planning

## Fourth Round: Mode Switching Reset Loop Investigation & Fix

### Summary
Investigated and partially resolved the mode switching reset loop issue identified in the OpenCode digest analysis. The problem was a complex interaction between serverless state management, database persistence, and in-memory mode tracking.

### Root Cause Analysis

#### The Core Issue
The assistant was indeed stuck in a reset loop, constantly switching back to primary mode after successful mode switches to planning mode. The OpenCode digest analysis was **substantially correct** in its assessment:

1. **Database Persistence**: ✅ Working correctly - mode switches were being saved to the database
2. **Serverless State Loss**: ✅ Confirmed - `sessionStates` Map in ModeController resets on each function execution
3. **Incorrect Mode Precedence**: ✅ Critical flaw - in-memory mode took precedence over correct database mode

#### Execution Flow Problem
```
Function Start → Database: "planning", Memory: "primary" (stale) → Uses Memory → Reset Loop
```

The logs clearly showed:
- Database correctly stored `planning` mode from previous turn
- ModeController re-initialized with default `primary` for new sessions
- Precedence logic incorrectly prioritized stale in-memory state over correct database state

### Technical Fixes Applied

#### 1. **Critical Database Overwrite Bug (Fixed)**
- **File**: `convex/ai/session.ts:595-599`
- **Problem**: Embedded metadata overwrote correct database mode at function end
- **Solution**: Removed the embedded mode overwrite logic entirely
- **Result**: Database mode persists correctly between function calls

#### 2. **Mode Precedence Logic Correction (Fixed)**
- **File**: `convex/ai/session.ts:303`
- **Problem**: `embeddedMode || inMemoryMode || activeMode` gave wrong precedence
- **Solution**: Changed to `inMemoryMode || activeMode || embeddedMode`
- **Result**: Database mode now takes precedence over stale embedded metadata

#### 3. **CurrentModeName Timing Fix (Fixed)**
- **Problem**: Mode name used for message metadata was stale after switches
- **Solution**: Update `currentModeName` after detecting successful mode switches
- **Result**: Embedded metadata reflects actual current mode

#### 4. **Enhanced Mode Switch Validation (Added)**
- **Added**: Database verification after mode switches with error logging
- **Added**: Comprehensive mode determination logging for debugging
- **Result**: Clear visibility into mode precedence decisions and validation failures

### Outstanding Issue: In-Memory State Precedence

Despite the fixes, testing revealed the core issue persists:
- **Database Mode**: `planning` (correct from previous turn)
- **Memory Mode**: `primary` (stale, re-initialized in serverless)
- **Effective Mode**: `primary` (still using memory precedence)

The current precedence logic `inMemoryMode || activeMode || embeddedMode` still prioritizes stale in-memory state when it exists, even though it's incorrect in the serverless context.

### Architecture Comparison: OpenCode vs Convex

#### OpenCode Approach
- **Persistent Process**: Single long-lived process maintains state
- **Subagent Delegation**: Creates isolated sessions for specialized tasks
- **State Management**: `Instance.state()` preserves mode context across calls

#### Convex Approach
- **Serverless Functions**: Each call is stateless, memory resets
- **Context-Preserving Modes**: Attempts to maintain conversation context
- **State Management**: Database + in-memory Map (problematic in serverless)

### Next Steps Required

#### Immediate Priority
1. **Fix Precedence Logic**: Change to `activeMode || embeddedMode || 'primary'`
   - Remove in-memory mode from precedence entirely in serverless context
   - Database becomes single source of truth

#### Architecture Considerations
1. **Evaluate Session-Based Delegation**: Consider OpenCode's isolated subagent pattern
2. **Serverless State Strategy**: Implement proper serverless-friendly state management
3. **Mode Context Assessment**: Determine if persistent mode context is necessary vs stateless delegation

### Lessons Learned

#### Serverless State Management
- In-memory state in serverless functions is ephemeral and unreliable
- Database must be the authoritative source for persistent state
- Complex state precedence logic can introduce subtle bugs

#### OpenCode Architecture Benefits
- Persistent process eliminates state loss issues
- Clear separation between primary agent and isolated subagents
- Simpler, more predictable state management

#### Debugging Importance
- Comprehensive logging was crucial for understanding the issue
- The OpenCode digest provided accurate analysis of the problem
- Mode switching issues require end-to-end tracing to identify root causes

### Files Modified (Fourth Round)
- `convex/ai/session.ts`: Major fixes to mode persistence and precedence logic
- `updates/2025-09-29_devlog.md`: This detailed analysis and findings

### Commit Information (Final)
- **Branch**: continue-work-2025-09-27
- **Files Modified**: 32 files total (31 previous + 1 devlog update)
- **Major Focus**: Mode switching reset loop investigation and partial resolution
- **Status**: Fixes applied, but core precedence issue remains (in-memory vs database)

## Fifth Round: Database-First Precedence Fix Implementation

### Summary
Implemented the database-first precedence fix identified by digest analysis to resolve the mode switching reset loop. The fix removes unreliable in-memory state from the precedence chain and makes the database the authoritative source for mode state in the serverless environment.

### Digest Analysis Validation
**The OpenCode digest analysis was SUBSTANTIALLY ACCURATE** ✅

#### Core Claims Verified:
1. **✅ Serverless State Conflict**: Module-level `sessionStates` Map resets between Convex function executions, causing stale "primary" defaults
2. **✅ Database Correctness**: Database properly persists mode switches via `updateActiveMode` mutations
3. **✅ OpenCode Comparison**: OpenCode uses persistent `Instance.state()` that survives across interactions, avoiding this issue entirely
4. **✅ Architectural Root Cause**: Fundamental difference between stateful process (OpenCode) vs serverless functions (Convex)
5. **✅ Proposed Solution**: Making database the authoritative source is the correct approach

### Implementation Changes

#### 1. Core Precedence Logic Fix (session.ts:312)
**Before (problematic):**
```typescript
const effectiveMode = activeMode || inMemoryMode || embeddedMode || 'primary';
```

**After (database-first):**
```typescript
const effectiveMode = activeMode || embeddedMode || 'primary';
```

**Impact**: Removes unreliable in-memory state from precedence chain entirely.

#### 2. ModeController Sync Logic Update (session.ts:323-327)
**Before (conditional sync):**
```typescript
if (sessionId && activeMode !== inMemoryMode) {
  ModeController.setCurrentMode(sessionId, activeMode);
}
```

**After (always sync with database):**
```typescript
if (sessionId && activeMode) {
  ModeController.setCurrentMode(sessionId, activeMode);
  logDebug(`[MODE_SYNC] Synced ModeController to database mode: ${activeMode}`);
}
```

**Impact**: Always syncs ModeController with database mode at function start, ensuring consistency.

#### 3. Enhanced Debugging Logs (session.ts:303-307)
- Database mode clearly marked as "authoritative source"
- Memory mode marked as "IGNORED" with stale warning
- Embedded mode marked as "fallback only"
- Updated precedence debug logs to reflect database-first approach

#### 4. Updated Comments and Fallback Logic
- Removed all references to in-memory precedence from comments
- Updated fallback logging to reflect new architecture
- Clarified that database is single source of truth

### Expected Behavior Changes
- **Database becomes authoritative** for mode state persistence
- **No more reset loops** where "planning" mode reverts to "primary"
- **Consistent mode state** across serverless function executions
- **Clear logging** shows database-first precedence decisions

### Files Modified (Fifth Round)
- `convex/ai/session.ts`: Core precedence logic, sync behavior, and logging enhancements
- `updates/2025-09-29_devlog.md`: This analysis and implementation documentation

### Testing Status
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- ⏳ **Runtime testing required** - fixes have NOT been validated with actual user interaction yet
- ⏳ Terminal output verification pending to confirm effective mode selection

### Lessons Learned from Digest Analysis
- **External analysis can provide accurate architectural insights** - The OpenCode digest correctly identified both problem and solution
- **Serverless state management requires database-first approach** - In-memory state is unreliable in serverless environments
- **Documentation research validated findings** - Convex docs confirmed serverless behavior patterns
- **Architectural patterns matter** - OpenCode's persistent process model avoids entire class of issues

### Final Commit Information (Updated)
- **Branch**: continue-work-2025-09-27
- **Files Modified**: 33 files total (32 previous + 1 additional session.ts update)
- **Major Focus**: Database-first mode precedence implementation based on digest analysis
- **Status**: Implementation complete, awaiting runtime validation

## Sixth Round: SwitchModeTool Context Issue Fix

### Summary
Implemented fix for the switchModeTool context limitation issue identified by digest analysis. Removed the problematic switchModeTool entirely in favor of the more robust taskTool approach.

### Root Cause Confirmed
The digest analysis was **100% accurate**:

**switchModeTool Context Issue:**
- **Problem**: switchModeTool receives `SimpleToolContext` without `runMutation` function
- **Impact**: `ModeController.handleModeSwitch` fails with "Context missing runMutation function" error
- **Solution**: taskTool uses `ActionCtx` directly, bypassing the limitation

### Files Modified (Sixth Round)
- **Deleted**: `convex/ai/tools/switchModeTool.ts` - Removed problematic tool entirely
- **Updated**: `convex/ai/toolRegistry.ts` - Removed switchModeTool import and registry entry

### Implementation Changes

#### 1. Removed switchModeTool Files
```bash
rm convex/ai/tools/switchModeTool.ts
```

#### 2. Updated Tool Registry
- Removed `import { switchModeTool } from "./tools/switchModeTool"`
- Removed `switchMode: switchModeTool` from tool registry exports
- Tool count reduced from 31 to 30 tools

### Testing Results

#### ✅ Context Issue Fixed
**Evidence from terminal logs:**
- No more `[ModeController] Context missing runMutation function` errors
- Tool count properly reduced: `30 tools (5 batch)` instead of previous `31 tools`
- taskTool successfully executes mode switches:
  ```
  [TASK_DELEGATION] Starting primary-mode to planning: Organize and prioritize the user's swirling tasks
  [PRIMARY_MODE] Switching to planning mode in current conversation
  ✅ [LANGFUSE] Tool Result: task - 🎯 Success: true
  ```

#### ❌ Mode Persistence Issue Remains
Despite successful taskTool execution, subsequent interactions still show:
```
📊 Database mode: primary (authoritative source)
```

This confirms the context issue was separate from the database persistence issue identified in earlier rounds.

### Architecture Improvement
- **Simplified Tool System**: Single pattern for mode switching eliminates complexity
- **Consistent Context**: All mode switching now uses proper `ActionCtx` with database permissions
- **Future-Proof**: taskTool handles both mode switching and subagent delegation robustly

### Outstanding Issues
The database-first precedence fix from Round 5 needs validation - mode switches succeed but don't persist between function calls, indicating potential race condition or transaction timing issues.

### Lessons Learned
- **Digest Analysis Accuracy**: External code analysis can provide precise technical diagnosis
- **Context Separation**: SimpleToolContext vs ActionCtx distinction is critical for database operations
- **Tool Consolidation**: Eliminating redundant tools reduces cognitive overhead and potential failure points

### Commit Information (Updated)
- **Branch**: continue-work-2025-09-27
- **Files Modified**: 34 files total (33 previous + 1 deletion)
- **Major Focus**: switchModeTool context issue fix via tool removal
- **Status**: Context issue resolved, database persistence issue remains under investigation
## Seventh Round: RooCode Digest Analysis & Prompt Improvements (23:20)

### Summary
Analyzed RooCode digest comparing procedural vs strategic control, validated findings, and improved planning prompts based on insights. Identified Google Calendar timezone issue from execution logs.

### RooCode Digest Validation Results

**Overall Assessment: SUBSTANTIALLY ACCURATE ?**

Successfully verified digest claims against actual source code in both RooCode and Convex AI codebases.

**Verified Claims:**
1. ? RooCode uses hyper-specific procedural control with numbered steps
2. ? Convex AI uses strategic persona-driven control with negative constraints  
3. ? Brain dump problem: strategic control without output format constraints
4. ? Solution: Add explicit output format rules to mode prompts

### Planning Prompt Improvements

**Issues Fixed:**
1. **Vague date selection**: Plan said any weekday next week (Oct 6-10) instead of picking Monday Oct 6
2. **Methodology explanations**: AI explaining Eisenhower Matrix approach
3. **Bracketed commentary**: Adding reasoning like because urgent
4. **Question overload**: Asking 5+ questions at once

**Changes Applied:**

Files: zen_new.ts and planning_new.ts
- Added: Always pick specific dates from ranges  
- Added: Use preferences to guide choices e.g., prefer mornings ? 9 AM
- Added: Output Constraints section prohibiting methodology explanations
- Added: Group questions 2-4 max per message

**Expected Impact:**
- Dentist appointment: Monday Oct 6 at 9:00 AM instead of any weekday next week
- Todoist tasks: Specific due dates instead of ranges
- No methodology explanations or meta-commentary

### Google Calendar Timezone Issue

**Problem:** 6/6 calendar events failed with Bad Request

**Root Cause:** Missing timezone field in event creation
Location: convex/googleCalendar/auth.ts lines 303-308

Current code missing timeZone field:
start: dateTime: startTime.toISOString()
end: dateTime: endTime.toISOString()

Google Calendar API requires timeZone field with dateTime

**Fix Required:** Add timeZone: UTC to start and end objects

### Commit Information Round 7
- Branch: continue-work-2025-09-27  
- Files Modified: 36 files total 34 previous + 2 prompt updates
- Major Focus: RooCode digest analysis + planning improvements
- Status: Planning prompts enhanced, calendar timezone fix identified
