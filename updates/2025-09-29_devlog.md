## Information-Collector to Planning Mode Transformation & Pattern Fixes

### Summary
Completed major transformation removing the information-collector mode and fixing robotic numbered conversation patterns. Also improved retry button functionality for rate limit errors.

### Key Changes

#### 1. Mode System Transformation
- **Deleted**: `convex/ai/prompts/information_collector_new.ts` (was causing robotic patterns)
- **Updated**: All mode references to use "planning" instead of "information-collector"
- **Fixed**: Schema, session handlers, and prompt loader to remove information-collector mode

#### 2. Conversation Pattern Fixes
- **Problem**: AI was producing robotic numbered questions like "To prioritize effectively, a couple quick questions: 1. 2."
- **Root Cause**: Old information_collector_new.ts prompt was still being loaded despite new planning prompts
- **Solution**: Removed numbered list patterns across all prompt files:
  - `zen_new.ts`: Converted numbered examples to bullet points
  - `toolUseGuidelines.ts`: Removed numbered workflow patterns
  - `execution_new.ts`: Converted numbered behaviors to natural descriptions
  - `planning_new.ts`: Complete rewrite for natural conversation flow

#### 3. Enhanced Retry Button for Rate Limits
- **Problem**: Rate limit errors (HTTP 429) weren't showing retry button
- **Root Cause**: Backend was returning errors as successful responses with metadata
- **Solution**:
  - Added `isRetriable` detection in `convex/ai/session.ts`
  - Enhanced error handling in `src/hooks/useConvexChat.ts` to detect backend error responses
  - Added `isRetriable?: boolean` to ChatMetadata interface

#### 4. Temperature Adjustment
- **Increased**: AI temperature from 0.4 to 0.6 in mode registry for more natural conversation
- **Goal**: Less robotic, more conversational responses while maintaining functionality

### Files Modified

#### Backend Changes
- `convex/schema.ts`: Removed information-collector from mode type union
- `convex/chatSessions.ts`: Updated all modeType unions to remove information-collector
- `convex/ai/system.ts`: Removed information-collector from mode prompt mapping
- `convex/ai/session.ts`:
  - Fixed error handling for retry button functionality
  - Updated comments to reference planning mode instead
- `convex/ai/modes/registry.ts`: Increased temperature to 0.6, updated prompt injection
- `convex/ai/prompts/promptLoader.ts`: Removed information_collector_new import and registry entries

#### Prompt System Overhaul
- `convex/ai/prompts/planning_new.ts`: Complete rewrite for natural conversation
- `convex/ai/prompts/zen_new.ts`: Fixed numbered patterns, improved examples
- `convex/ai/prompts/execution_new.ts`: Converted to natural language descriptions
- `convex/ai/prompts/sections/toolUseGuidelines.ts`: Removed numbered workflow patterns
- `convex/ai/prompts/sections/modes.ts`: Updated mode documentation

#### Frontend Changes
- `src/hooks/useConvexChat.ts`: Enhanced error detection for response metadata
- `src/components/chat/Chat.tsx`: Improved retry button state management
- `src/components/chat/ConversationTurn.tsx`: Better error display handling
- `src/context/chat.tsx`: Enhanced error state management

### Technical Details

#### TypeScript Error Resolution
- **Error**: `Cannot find module './information_collector_new'`
- **Fix**: Removed import and registry references from promptLoader.ts

#### Mode Switching Logic
- Primary mode can delegate to any subagent
- Planning mode can delegate to execution subagent only
- All information-collector references now route to planning mode

#### Error Handling Flow
1. Backend detects rate limit (HTTP 429)
2. Sets `isRetriable: true` in response metadata
3. Frontend detects error in metadata and enables retry button
4. User can retry the same request

### Testing Status
- ✅ TypeScript compilation fixed
- ⏳ Runtime testing pending
- ⏳ User interaction flow testing pending

### Next Steps
1. Test the transformed planning mode in real conversations
2. Verify retry button works for rate limit scenarios
3. Monitor for any remaining robotic patterns
4. Consider user feedback on the more natural conversation flow

### Lessons Learned
- Multiple prompt files can create conflicting behavior patterns
- File-based prompt loading requires careful registry management
- Error handling flows need end-to-end consideration (backend → frontend)
- Natural conversation requires both content and structural changes

## Second Round: Methodology Explanation Fixes

### Summary
Additional prompt fixes to eliminate AI methodology explanations and improve follow-up questions for scheduling timing.

### Key Issues Addressed

#### 1. Methodology Explanation Removal
- **Problem**: AI still saying "Based on what you shared, here's a prioritized plan using urgency and importance (Eisenhower style)"
- **Root Cause**: Planning prompt contained language encouraging method explanations
- **Solution**: Removed specific lines causing methodology mentions:
  - Deleted: "Make it clear you're analyzing timing and consequences"
  - Changed: "Explain you're helping them figure out what to tackle first" → "Help them figure out what to tackle first"

#### 2. Explicit Method Prohibition
- **Added**: New "NEVER EXPLAIN" section in planning_new.ts
- **Prohibited**: Methods, approaches, analysis explanations (e.g., "Eisenhower style", "urgency and importance")
- **Updated**: AVOID examples with specific forbidden phrases

#### 3. Follow-up Question Requirements
- **Problem**: AI not asking when to schedule things (car registration timing, move specific time)
- **Solution**:
  - Added requirement to ask "When to schedule tasks (not just deadlines, but actual scheduling timing)"
  - Updated conversation flow to "Must ask about scheduling timing"
  - Enhanced examples to show proper scheduling follow-up questions

#### 4. Cross-File Consistency
- **Updated**: All references to "Eisenhower Matrix" → "priority and urgency principles"
- **Files**: registry.ts, rules.ts, capabilities.ts, toolUseGuidelines.ts
- **Goal**: Consistent terminology that doesn't encourage methodology explanations

### Files Modified (Second Round)

#### Core Prompt Files
- `convex/ai/prompts/planning_new.ts`:
  - Removed method explanation triggers
  - Added explicit "NEVER EXPLAIN" rules
  - Enhanced follow-up question requirements
  - Updated examples with scheduling questions
- `convex/ai/modes/registry.ts`: Updated description to remove "Eisenhower Matrix"

#### Supporting Prompt Sections
- `convex/ai/prompts/sections/rules.ts`: Updated methodology references
- `convex/ai/prompts/sections/capabilities.ts`: Updated methodology references
- `convex/ai/prompts/sections/toolUseGuidelines.ts`: Updated methodology references

### Expected Improvements
- ✅ No more "Eisenhower style" or methodology explanations
- ✅ Natural follow-up questions about scheduling timing
- ✅ AI asks "when should we schedule X" not just "when is X due"
- ✅ Consistent terminology across all prompt files

### Investigation Notes
- **Critical Issue**: AI still using forbidden phrases from AVOID examples
- **Next Steps**: Investigate prompt loading mechanism and potential caching issues
- **User Feedback**: Need initial plan first, then follow-up questions about scheduling

### Commit Information
- **Branch**: continue-work-2025-09-27
- **Files Modified**: 23 files total (18 initial + 5 additional)
- **Key Deletion**: information_collector_new.ts
- **Major Focus**: Natural conversation patterns, error handling, and methodology explanation removal
