## Per-user monthly token cap via OpenRouter + Vercel AI SDK (01:08)

**Status**: ✅ Hard cap of 1,000,000 tokens/user/month enforced with server-side accounting

### Context
Goal was to add robust, per-user token quota enforcement without custom tokenizers, leveraging Vercel AI SDK usage and OpenRouter features. We chose append-only accounting + pre-checks + per-call output caps to prevent single-call overflow.

### Implementation

1) Schema additions (convex/schema.ts:383-410)
- Added `usageEvents` table with indexes `by_tokenIdentifier` and `by_tokenIdentifier_and_ts`
- Added `usageQuotas` table for per-user monthly cap overrides (defaults applied in logic)

2) Usage API (convex/usage.ts:1-58)
- `getMonthlyTotal(tokenIdentifier, monthStart?)` sums totalTokens in current month
- `getMonthlyCap(tokenIdentifier)` returns override or default 1,000,000
- `recordEvent(...)` inserts append-only usage record per request

3) Enforcement in chat pipeline (convex/ai/session.ts:497-503, 582-589, 617-632)
- Pre-check monthly usage and cap; reject if exhausted; compute `remainingMonthly`
- Set `maxTokens` in model call to prevent exceeding remaining budget in a single call
- After response, persist `result.usage` to `usageEvents`
- Also added OpenRouter `extraBody.user = tokenIdentifier` for per-user routing/analytics

### Result
All requests now respect a hard monthly per-user token budget. If at cap, user receives quota-exceeded error; otherwise, output tokens are limited to remaining monthly budget. Usage is recorded append-only for accurate rollups. OpenRouter receives stable per-user `user` field for analytics.

### Files Changed
- `convex/schema.ts` (usageEvents, usageQuotas tables + indexes)
- `convex/usage.ts` (new)
- `convex/ai/session.ts` (pre-check, maxTokens, post-record, OpenRouter user)

### Next
- Optional: Add RPM/RPH request rate caps; add admin overrides UI
- Add monthly rollups for faster analytics

### Post-Implementation Update - Stripe References Removed
Removed all references to specific payment processors (Stripe) from both files:
- PrivacyPolicy.tsx: Changed "processed securely by Stripe" to generic "third-party payment provider"
- TermsOfService.tsx: Removed Stripe reference, changed to generic payment provider language
- TermsOfService.tsx: Removed "payment processor policies" from refund section

Files updated to remain payment-agnostic and not reveal specific processor details.

## Google Calendar timezone-safe event creation (evening)

**Status**: ✅ Exact user times preserved (no shifts); UI shows requested hours

### Context
Events like “tomorrow 10am–3pm” showed as 2–7pm due to UTC conversions and missing/incorrect timeZone.

### Changes Made
- `ea-ai-main2/ea-ai-main2/convex/ai/prompts/execution_new.ts`: Require local date-time strings (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS) with separate IANA timeZone; removed UTC “Z” requirement.
- `ea-ai-main2/ea-ai-main2/convex/ai/tools/googleCalendar.ts`: Removed toISOString(); resolved user timeZone via Calendar settings/currentCalendarTime; validated no Z/offset; sent `{ start:{dateTime,timeZone}, end:{dateTime,timeZone} }`.
- `ea-ai-main2/ea-ai-main2/convex/googleCalendar/auth.ts`: Added structured insert path; legacy path enriches with user tz; added validation guards and concise logging.

### Result
Created events match the exact wall time stated by the user (e.g., 10:00–15:00) with no offset-induced shifts.

### Notes
- Guardrails reject inputs containing Z/offset; getCurrentTime prefers Google Calendar timezone to avoid server UTC fallback.
