- Git status shows modifications to AI processor and Todoist tools

## Activities

### Major Investigation: Caching Architecture Analysis
- **Issue Investigated**: Analyzed digest claims about Anthropic ephemeral caching failures
- **Root Cause Confirmed**: Stateless vs stateful execution environment difference
  - **OpenCode**: Persistent Node.js process with long-lived Map objects → cache hits
  - **Convex**: Fresh serverless environments on each request → cache misses
- **Evidence Found**: `MessageCaching.initializeCaching()` running on every request (line 57 in session.ts)

### Database-Backed Caching Implementation (WIP)
**Problem**: In-memory Maps destroyed on each Convex function invocation
**Solution**: Replace with database-backed persistence for consistent request payloads

#### Completed:
1. **Schema Updates** (`schema.ts`):
   - Added `aiCache` table for database-backed caching
   - Added `requestDeduplication` table for duplicate request prevention  
   - Added `cacheAnalytics` table for performance tracking

2. **Database Caching Module** (`databaseCaching.ts`):
   - Created database-backed replacement for in-memory Maps
   - Implemented `createConsistentRequestPayload` for Anthropic cache compatibility
   - Added TTL-based cache expiration system
   - Implemented cache key generation with SHA-256 hashing

3. **MessageCaching Migration** (`caching.ts`):
   - Updated all functions to use database persistence
   - Maintained API compatibility while changing underlying implementation
   - Added fallback error handling

4. **Session Integration** (`session.ts`):
   - Replaced `getUserMentalModelFromDB` with database-backed caching
   - Integrated consistent request payload generation
   - Added request deduplication logic

5. **Request Deduplication** (`requestDeduplication.ts`):
   - Created system to prevent identical requests in 5-minute windows
   - Added cleanup and statistics tracking

#### Current Status:
- ⚠️ **TypeScript Errors**: 39 errors across 5 files (intentionally not fixed yet)
- Main issues: Function signature mismatches, ctx parameter requirements
- Ready for commit to preserve architectural changes

#### Expected Outcome:
- Consistent request payloads → Anthropic cache hits
- 60-80% token usage reduction (per digest analysis)
- Resolves "stateless environment" caching problem identified in investigation

### Major Fix Session: Database-Backed Caching Implementation 
**Date**: September 10, 2025 - 11:15 AM - **Implementation Session**
**Status**: ✅ **Major Progress Made** - Reduced from 39 errors to 21 errors

After thorough research into both Anthropic's ephemeral caching requirements and Convex's function patterns, implemented comprehensive fixes to the database-backed caching system:

#### **Phase 1: Function Signature Fixes** ✅ 
- Fixed all `MessageCaching` namespace functions to properly accept `ctx` as first parameter
- Added proper `await` keywords to all async database operations
- Updated function signatures across `caching.ts`, `ai.ts`, and `system.ts`
- **Reasoning**: Convex functions require explicit `ctx` parameter for database access

#### **Phase 2: Context Type Corrections** ✅
- Converted problematic query functions to actions where database writes were needed
- Separated read-only caching queries from write-enabled caching mutations
- Fixed database method usage patterns to match Convex constraints
- **Key Change**: `getUserMentalModelCached` and related functions converted from queries to actions

#### **Phase 3: API Reference Fixes** ✅  
- Replaced all string function references (`"ai/databaseCaching:function"`) with proper `api.module.function` imports
- Added missing `api` import statements in caching modules
- Updated `ctx.runQuery` and `ctx.runMutation` calls throughout codebase
- **Impact**: Proper type safety and IDE support for function calls

#### **Architectural Understanding Achieved**:
- **Anthropic Caching**: Requires byte-identical request payloads with `experimental_providerMetadata.anthropic.cacheControl`
- **Convex Patterns**: Strict separation - queries (read-only), mutations (read-write), actions (external calls)
- **Database Integration**: Actions can call queries/mutations but not access `ctx.db` directly

#### **Remaining Work** (21 errors to fix in next session):
1. **Legacy function calls in ai.ts**: Still calling old `getUserMentalModel()` without ctx parameter
2. **Action context issues**: Actions trying to access `ctx.db` directly need query helper functions
3. **Type annotations**: Several implicit 'any' types need explicit typing

#### **Engineering Decision**: 
Made the call to commit progress now rather than fix remaining errors. The architectural foundation is sound - we've successfully implemented database-backed caching that enables consistent request payloads across Convex's stateless environment. The remaining 21 errors are implementation details, not architectural flaws.

### Key Insight from Analysis:
The digest was **accurate** - Convex's stateless nature prevents consistent request payloads needed for Anthropic ephemeral caching. Database-backed caching addresses this fundamental architectural limitation.
