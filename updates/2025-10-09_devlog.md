## Google Calendar OAuth refactor to Clerk + Node runtime fixes (22:05)

**Status**: ⚠️ Connect/disconnect flows working via Clerk; one UI mutation hook fix pending

### Context
Moved Calendar consent from login to Settings. Initial dedicated Google OAuth (googleapis) caused Convex Node bundling issues and UX mismatch with Clerk scopes; switched to Clerk reauthorization flow for Calendar scopes.

### Changes Made
- convex/googleCalendar/auth.ts: Node-only actions, added handleGoogleCalendarOAuthCallback, switched hasConnection/test to use Clerk tokens; added soft disconnect using settings flag instead of deleting external account; removed DB fallback logic
- convex/googleCalendar/tokens.ts: New module with get/store/delete refresh token (legacy) plus get/setGoogleCalendarEnabled
- convex/http.ts: Removed Node imports; delegate callback to Node action; keep router in non-node runtime
- convex/schema.ts: Added googleCalendarSettings table for per-user enabled flag
- src/views/SettingsView.tsx: Wired ConnectedAppItem onConnect correctly; switched connect flow to Clerk reauthorize/createExternalAccount popup; listen for GCAL_CONNECTED and enable flag
- src/components/AuthCallback.tsx: If in popup, post GCAL_CONNECTED to opener and close window; otherwise redirect normally
- convex/chatSessions.ts: Fixed implicit any errors; added explicit types

### Result
Convex builds cleanly; Google consent now via Clerk popup; popup closes and main app refreshes. Disconnect toggles a server-side enabled flag (SSO preserved). Pending: useMutation for setGoogleCalendarEnabled (currently called as action, causing log warnings).
