**Status**: ✅ Streamlined settings UI; removed unsupported integrations and simplified account actions

- Updated Connected Apps to only show Google Calendar and Todoist
  - File: ea-ai-main2/ea-ai-main2/src/views/SettingsView.tsx
  - File: ea-ai-main2/ea-ai-main2/src/components/SettingsModal.tsx
- Account section cleanup
  - Removed "Active" badge and delete-account warning paragraph
  - Shrunk buttons (h-9, text-sm) and changed to content width; stacked vertically with gap
