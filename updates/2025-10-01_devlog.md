# Development Log - 2025-10-01

## Session Context
- Date: October 1, 2025
- Branch: fix-google-calendar-tool-2025-09-30
- Goal: Restore stalled OpenRouter provider enhancement work, align schema/back-end with new detailed provider cache, and document current blockers.

## Work Completed
- Added `cachedDetailedOpenrouterModels` table to `convex/schema.ts`, mirroring the enriched model structure (provider slugs, endpoints, pricing details, architecture metadata, etc.).
- Expanded `ModelInfo`/`DetailedModelInfo` typing to include release metadata, attachment/tool flags, cost/limit objects, and provider-specific fields to keep frontend/backend contracts consistent.
- Updated Convex detailed fetch action (now in `convex/providers/openrouterDetailed.ts`) to hydrate detailed info from `/endpoints` + base `/models`, capture provider slugs, and persist enriched fields in the new cache table.
- Renamed the Convex module from `openrouter-detailed.ts` → `openrouterDetailed.ts` to satisfy Convex module naming rules; updated frontend (`AdminDashboard.tsx`) to call the new module path.
- Verified TypeScript compilation after refactors with `npx tsc --noEmit` (passes when run with increased Node heap).

## Outstanding Issues / Errors Observed
1. **Convex runtime validation errors**
   - `getCachedDetailedModelInfo` query is invoked with `{}` from the dashboard (missing required `modelId`), causing repeated `ArgumentValidationError`. Need to guard the useQuery or make args optional.
   - Detailed cache mutation fails on models whose `architecture` contains extra keys (`input_modalities`, `output_modalities`). Schema must either accept these fields or the action should strip them before caching.

2. **Lint still failing repository-wide**
   - `npm run lint` continues to surface hundreds of pre-existing warnings/errors (namespaces, unused vars, await-thenable, misused promises, etc.). No fixes attempted in this session; command left failing after reporting.

3. **Convex deploy script failure**
   - Earlier attempts to run `convex dev --once` errored until the module rename (Convex disallows dashes). After rename, deploy not re-tested during this session.

## Next Steps / Recommendations
- Update `openrouterDetailed` schema validators to tolerate OpenRouter's `architecture` fields (either widen the validator or sanitize the payload before caching).
- Ensure `AdminDashboard` only calls `getCachedDetailedModelInfo` when a `modelId` exists (or switch to optional validator).
- Rerun Convex deploy after addressing validation issues to confirm the enriched cache flows work end-to-end.
- Lint backlog remains large; schedule dedicated cleanup once feature is stable.

## Session 2: Validation Error Fixes

### Work Completed
1. **Fixed `isFetchingDetailedModel` initialization error**
   - Removed `getCachedDetailedModelInfo` query hook that was referencing uninitialized state variable
   - Removed cached check logic and updated dependency arrays
   - AdminDashboard now loads without initialization errors

2. **Fixed `architecture` validation errors**
   - Added `input_modalities` and `output_modalities` array fields to architecture validator in `schema.ts`
   - Added same fields to mutation validator in `openrouterDetailed.ts`
   - Resolved "extra field not in validator" errors

3. **Fixed `top_provider.max_completion_tokens` validation errors**
   - Changed `max_completion_tokens` from `v.number()` to `v.optional(v.union(v.number(), v.null()))` in both `schema.ts` and `openrouterDetailed.ts`
   - Allows OpenRouter API's null values to pass validation

4. **Added auto-fetch logic for detailed model info**
   - Added useEffect in `AdminDashboard.tsx` to automatically fetch detailed model info when a model is selected
   - Triggers `fetchDetailedModelInfoForModel` on model selection

### Outstanding Issues
1. **Provider dropdown still not showing actual providers**
   - Despite fixing validation errors, dropdown only shows "websearch" and "internal reasoning" options
   - These appear to be model parameters rather than provider routing options (anthropic, openai, google, etc.)
   - Detailed fetch appears to complete successfully but provider slugs not populating correctly
   - Root cause: Provider slug extraction logic or display logic needs investigation

2. **Validation errors still persisting in Convex logs**
   - Despite schema updates, still seeing `max_completion_tokens: null` validation errors in logs
   - Suggests schema changes may not have been deployed to Convex backend
   - May require Convex deployment/push to apply schema changes

## Next Steps / Recommendations
- Investigate why schema changes aren't taking effect (may need `convex deploy` or restart)
- Debug provider slug extraction from `/endpoints` API response
- Verify that `providerSlugs` array is being populated in `enhancedModels` state
- Check if provider dropdown is reading from correct data source
- Consider logging actual API response structure to understand what data is available

## Notes
- All code changes committed but not yet deployed to Convex backend
- TypeScript compilation passes successfully
- AdminDashboard component now loads without initialization errors

## Session 3: Provider Routing Bug Fix and Digest Validation

### Summary
Investigated AI-generated digest claiming provider routing feature needed frontend implementation. Through systematic code analysis and API testing, discovered the digest was fundamentally misleading - the frontend was already fully built, but backend had two critical bugs preventing it from working.

### Digest Analysis Results

**Digest Claim**: "Your backend is ready, just build the frontend interface"

**Reality**: 
- ✅ Backend schema and API call logic correctly implemented
- ✅ Frontend already fully built with all required UI components
- ❌ **Two critical bugs** prevented the feature from working

### Investigation Process

1. **Code Trace**: Verified all digest claims against actual code
   - `systemConfigSchema` has `openRouterSpecificProvider` field ✅
   - `session.ts` creates correct provider routing object ✅
   - Passes via `extraBody` to OpenRouter SDK ✅
   - AdminDashboard already has complete UI ✅

2. **Frontend Components Found** (Already Built):
   - State management: `openRouterSpecificProvider`
   - Auto-fetch logic: `fetchDetailedModelInfoForModel()`
   - Provider dropdown UI with "Auto (highest availability)"
   - Save logic: `handleProviderSelect()`
   - Provider validation and reset logic
   - The digest's example code was already implemented!

3. **Actual Problems Discovered**:
   - Bug 1: Provider extraction reading wrong API response path
   - Bug 2: Schema validation rejecting null values
   - Bug 3: Infinite loop when 0 providers cached

### Bugs Fixed

#### Bug 1: Wrong API Response Path
**File**: `convex/providers/openrouterDetailed.ts`

**Problem**: Code was checking `endpointsData.data` (an object) instead of `endpointsData.data.endpoints` (the array).

**API Response Structure**:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "...",
    "endpoints": [
      { "tag": "deepinfra", "provider_name": "DeepInfra", ... },
      { "tag": "novita/fp8", "provider_name": "Novita", ... },
      { "tag": "deepseek", "provider_name": "DeepSeek", ... }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Fix Applied**:
- Changed to check `endpointsData.data.endpoints` array
- Extract from `endpoint.tag` field (the provider slug)
- Added debug logging to see actual API responses
- Added flexible handling for different response formats

**Result**: Now correctly extracts providers: `["deepinfra", "novita/fp8", "gmicloud/fp8", "atlas-cloud/fp8", "deepseek"]`

#### Bug 2: Schema Validation for Null Values
**Files**: `convex/providers/openrouterDetailed.ts`, `convex/schema.ts`, `convex/providers/openrouter.ts`

**Problem**: OpenRouter API returns `"instruct_type": null` for some models, but schema had `v.optional(v.string())` which rejects null.

**Error**:
```
ArgumentValidationError: Value does not match validator.
Path: .detailedInfo.architecture.instruct_type
Value: null
Validator: v.string()
```

**Fix Applied**: Changed all three files from:
```typescript
instruct_type: v.optional(v.string())  // ❌ Rejects null
```

To:
```typescript
instruct_type: v.optional(v.union(v.string(), v.null()))  // ✅ Accepts null
```

#### Bug 3: Infinite Loop Protection
**File**: `src/views/AdminDashboard.tsx`

**Problem**: When provider extraction returned 0 providers, the condition `providerSlugs.length === 0` stayed true, causing infinite re-fetches.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `fetchAttempts` state to track attempts per model
- Max 2 attempts per model with warning on limit
- Changed condition from `length === 0` to `!providerSlugs` (only fetch if undefined)

### Removed Buggy Code

**File**: `convex/providers/openrouterDetailed.ts`

Removed pricing-based provider extraction that was adding pricing field names as providers:
- Removed code that extracted from `modelInfo.pricing` keys
- This was adding "web_search", "internal_reasoning" as fake providers
- The `/endpoints` API is the authoritative source

### Files Modified (Session 3)
- `convex/providers/openrouterDetailed.ts`: Fixed extraction path, added debug logging, fixed schema, removed buggy pricing extraction
- `convex/schema.ts`: Fixed `instruct_type` null validation
- `convex/providers/openrouter.ts`: Fixed `instruct_type` null validation
- `src/views/AdminDashboard.tsx`: Added infinite loop protection
- `updates/2025-10-01_devlog.md`: This documentation

### Technical Details

**Provider Extraction Fix**:
```typescript
// OLD (Wrong path):
if (endpointsData.data && Array.isArray(endpointsData.data))

// NEW (Correct path):
if (endpointsData.data?.endpoints && Array.isArray(endpointsData.data.endpoints))
  endpointsData.data.endpoints.forEach((endpoint: any) => {
    if (endpoint.tag) {
      providerSlugs.add(endpoint.tag);  // Use tag field
    }
  });
```

**Convex Validator Pattern**:
- `v.optional(T)`: Field can be missing, but if present must be type T
- `v.union(T1, T2)`: Field must be either T1 or T2
- `v.optional(v.union(v.string(), v.null()))`: Field can be missing, string, or null ✅

### Testing Results
- Provider extraction working: `["xai"]`, `["deepinfra", "novita/fp8", ...]`
- No validation errors on cache save
- Infinite loop protection working (max 2 attempts)
- TypeScript compilation passes

### Lessons Learned

1. **AI-Generated Analysis Needs Verification**
   - The digest correctly identified backend implementation but completely missed that frontend was already built
   - Claimed "just need to build frontend" when the real issue was backend bugs
   - Always trace actual code execution vs trusting analysis

2. **Debug Logging is Critical**
   - Adding `console.log(JSON.stringify(endpointsData))` immediately revealed the actual API structure
   - Without seeing real data, we were guessing at formats

3. **Convex Schema Strictness**
   - Convex validators are stricter than TypeScript types
   - Must explicitly handle null vs undefined vs missing
   - Schema changes require Convex redeployment

4. **Infinite Loop Prevention**
   - When working with auto-fetch logic, always add attempt limits
   - Conditions like `array.length === 0` can create infinite loops if the underlying issue isn't fixed
