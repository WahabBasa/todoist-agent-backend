## Startup Routine Completed
- Created devlog file
- Verified project structure

## Enhanced Planning Agent Implementation
- Modified existing planning agent prompt to use leading questions for priority clarification
- Implemented intelligent priority detection based on user responses
- Added enhanced task capture and priority clarification techniques
- Created leading question techniques to avoid direct prioritization requests
- Updated communication style to match existing system patterns
- Created documentation and test files
- Integrated with existing internal todo system

## Improved Direct Question Approach
- Revised planning agent to use direct, concrete questions instead of hypotheticals
- Focused on fact-based questions that surface unconscious priorities
- Eliminated questions that require user processing or hypothetical thinking
- Implemented one-task-at-a-time approach with progressive discovery
- Created clear examples and documentation for the new approach

## Brain Dump Handling with Automatic Prioritization
- Updated planning agent to automatically infer priorities from user's emotional language and mention patterns
- Implemented immediate internal todo list creation from brain dumps
- Added systematic progression through tasks based on inferred priority
- Eliminated all user prioritization requirements
- Enhanced internal tracking of task clarification status
- Created examples and documentation for brain dump scenarios

## Unified Prompt Approach Fix
- Fixed inconsistencies in prompts that were still asking users to prioritize
- Ensured both primary and planning agents follow the same principle of automatic prioritization
- Updated examples to show correct approach without user prioritization
- Created unified documentation for consistent approach across all agents
- Verified coherence between all prompt files
- Fixed additional problematic examples in zen.ts and zen.txt files

The enhanced system now maintains a consistent approach where agents automatically infer priorities from user language and emotional cues, create internal todo lists from brain dumps, and work through tasks systematically without requiring any user prioritization decisions. All prompts have been aligned to follow this unified approach.
