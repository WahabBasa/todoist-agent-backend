## Firebase Custom Domain Setup & DNS Configuration (19:30)

**Status**: ✅ Root domain live and accessible; www subdomain DNS configured, SSL provisioning in progress

### Context
Discovered custom domain (`oldowan.uk`) showed "connected" in Firebase console but browser couldn't reach it. Systematic DNS troubleshooting revealed subdomain routing issue between Cloudflare and Firebase.

### Changes Made

**Diagnostics:**
- `nslookup oldowan.uk` - Confirmed DNS resolves to Cloudflare IP `199.36.158.100`
- `curl -I https://oldowan.uk` - HTTP 200 OK response; Firebase serving content successfully
- `nslookup -type=TXT oldowan.uk` - Verified Firebase ownership: `hosting-site=miller-ea-ai`
- `nslookup www.oldowan.uk` - Confirmed www subdomain missing ("Non-existent domain")

**Root Cause:** 
- Firebase configured for root domain only (`oldowan.uk`)
- www subdomain (`www.oldowan.uk`) had no DNS record
- User was testing with www variant, which doesn't exist

**Resolution:**
- Root domain (`oldowan.uk`) already working - no changes needed
- Added CNAME record in Cloudflare DNS for www subdomain:
  - Type: CNAME
  - Name: www
  - Target: oldowan.uk
  - Proxy: Gray cloud (DNS only)
  - TTL: Auto

### Result

**Immediate:** 
- Root domain `https://oldowan.uk` live and fully accessible
- TXT verification records confirm Firebase ownership

**In Progress:**
- www subdomain DNS propagation (5-30 minutes typical)
- Firebase SSL certificate provisioning for www.oldowan.uk (automatic, background process)

### Performance Notes

Landing page load time slower than Firebase default domain due to:
1. Cloudflare proxy overhead (~50-200ms latency)
2. First-request cache miss (subsequent requests cached)
3. React bundle processing on initial load

**Next Steps:**
- Monitor www.oldowan.uk SSL provisioning (check Firebase > Hosting > Custom domains)
- Verify www accessible after 15-minute wait
- Consider bundle optimization if load times remain sluggish
